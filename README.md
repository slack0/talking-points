# Talking Points

## Summary Generation from Political Speeches

```
Summarizing the most salient talking points of speeches is a necessity
in many spheres of our public and professional lives. In the era of
information overload, we hardly have time to pay attention to many
aspects that have professional, political and financial implications. 


My project aims to address this problem by providing users with an accurate
summary of the most important topics of speeches based on speaking style
(word usage) of a specific person (i.e., from a speech corpus). By using
NLP topic extraction and vectorization techniques, I created a
summarization tool that provides an accurate summary of the most
important talking points from any given speech. 

Results show that this technique outperforms similar summarization 
techniques that rely only on sentence similarity.
