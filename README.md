# Talking Points

An accurate summarization tool for politcal speeches and interviews.

## Introduction

Speech summarization is a necessity in many domains. It is needed in
cases where the audience needs to get a gist of a speech or an article
in a way that preserves the intent and the meaning of the speech. This
problem belongs to a class of problems under [Automatic
summarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization).
The main idea of summarization is to find a representative subset of
the data, which contains the information of the entire set.
Document summarization, tries to automatically create a representative
summary or abstract of the entire document, by finding the most informative
sentences.

Summary generation is difficult and is context dependent.
The objective and the metrics of summarization process themselves are difficult
to define in some situations. Extracting information that is representative of
an entire discussion/topic/speech is nuanced as the speaker may convey meaning
implicitly while referring to a past or a future discussion.

In this work, we consider the problem of summary extraction from
documents/speeches based on the knowledge of what it is about. The main
intuition here is that the inference about the topic of discussion is valuable
in evaluating which parts of a document or a speech are relevant to it.

This tool solves this problem by providing users with an accurate
summary of the most important topics of speeches based on speaking style
(word usage) of a specific person (i.e., from a speech corpus). By using
NLP topic extraction and vectorization techniques, I created a
summarization tool that provides an accurate summary of the most
important talking points from any given speech.

Results show that this technique outperforms similar summarization
techniques that rely only on sentence similarity.




## Summary Generation from Political Speeches


My project aims to address this problem by providing users with an accurate
summary of the most important topics of speeches based on speaking style
(word usage) of a specific person (i.e., from a speech corpus). By using
NLP topic extraction and vectorization techniques, I created a
summarization tool that provides an accurate summary of the most
important talking points from any given speech.

Results show that this technique outperforms similar summarization
techniques that rely only on sentence similarity.
