<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank Senator Bill 
		Nelson and NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden for their extraordinary 
		leadership.&nbsp; I want to recognize Dr. Buzz Aldrin as well, who’s in the 
		house.&nbsp; Four decades ago, Buzz became a legend.&nbsp; But in the 
		four decades since he’s also been one of America’s leading visionaries 
		and authorities on human space flight.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Few people -- present 
		company excluded -- can claim the expertise of Buzz and Bill and Charlie 
		when it comes to space exploration.&nbsp; I have to say that few people are 
		as singularly unimpressed by Air Force One as those three.&nbsp; Sure, it’s comfortable, but it can’t even reach low Earth orbit.&nbsp; And 
		that obviously is in striking contrast to the Falcon 9 rocket we just 
		saw on the launch pad, which will be tested for the very first time in 
		the coming weeks.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A couple of other 
		acknowledgments I want to make.&nbsp; We’ve got Congresswoman Sheila Jackson 
		Lee from Texas visiting us, a big supporter of the space program.&nbsp;My director, Office of Science and Technology Policy -- in 
		other words my chief science advisor -- John Holdren is here.&nbsp;And most of all I want to acknowledge your congresswoman 
		Suzanne Kosmas, because every time I meet with her, including the flight 
		down here, she reminds me of how important our NASA programs are and how 
		important this facility is.&nbsp; And she is fighting for every single one of 
		you and for her district and for the jobs in her district.&nbsp; And you 
		should know that you’ve got a great champion in Congresswoman Kosmas.&nbsp; 
		Please give her a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also want to thank 
		everybody for participating in today’s conference.&nbsp; And gathered here 
		are scientists, engineers, business leaders, public servants, and a few 
		more astronauts as well.&nbsp; Last but not least, I want to thank the men 
		and women of NASA for welcoming me to the Kennedy Space Center, and for 
		your contributions not only to America, but to the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here at the Kennedy Space 
		Center we are surrounded by monuments and milestones of those 
		contributions.&nbsp; It was from here that NASA launched the missions of 
		Mercury and Gemini and Apollo.&nbsp; It was from here that Space Shuttle 
		Discovery, piloted by Charlie Bolden, carried the Hubble Telescope into 
		orbit, allowing us to plumb the deepest recesses of our galaxy.&nbsp; And I 
		should point out, by the way, that in my private office just off the 
		Oval, I’ve got the picture of Jupiter from the Hubble.&nbsp; So thank you, 
		Charlie, for helping to decorate my office.&nbsp; It was from 
		here that men and women, propelled by sheer nerve and talent, set about 
		pushing the boundaries of humanity’s reach.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s the story of NASA.&nbsp; 
		And it’s a story that started a little more than half a century ago, far 
		from the Space Coast, in a remote and desolate region of what is now 
		called Kazakhstan.&nbsp; Because it was from there that the Soviet Union 
		launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth, 
		which was little more than a few pieces of metal with a transmitter and 
		a battery strapped to the top of a missile.&nbsp; But the world was stunned.&nbsp; 
		Americans were dumbfounded.&nbsp; The Soviets, it was perceived, had taken 
		the lead in a race for which we were not yet fully prepared.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we caught up very 
		quick.&nbsp; President Eisenhower signed legislation to create NASA and to 
		invest in science and math education, from grade school to graduate 
		school.&nbsp; In 1961, President Kennedy boldly declared before a joint 
		session of Congress that the United States would send a man to the Moon 
		and return him safely to the Earth within the decade.&nbsp; And as a nation, 
		we set about meeting that goal, reaping rewards that have in the decades 
		since touched every facet of our lives.&nbsp; NASA was at the forefront.&nbsp; 
		Many gave their careers to the effort.&nbsp; And some have given far more.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the years that have 
		followed, the space race inspired a generation of scientists and 
		innovators, including, I’m sure, many of you.&nbsp; It’s contributed to 
		immeasurable technological advances that have improved our health and 
		well-being, from satellite navigation to water purification, from 
		aerospace manufacturing to medical imaging.&nbsp; Although, I have to say, 
		during a meeting right before I came out on stage somebody said, you 
		know, it’s more than just Tang -- and I had to point out I actually 
		really like Tang.&nbsp;I thought that was very cool.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And leading the world to 
		space helped America achieve new heights of prosperity here on Earth, 
		while demonstrating the power of a free and open society to harness the 
		ingenuity of its people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And on a personal note, I 
		have been part of that generation so inspired by the space program.&nbsp; 
		1961 was the year of my birth -- the year that Kennedy made his 
		announcement.&nbsp; And one of my earliest memories is sitting on my 
		grandfather’s shoulders, waving a flag as astronauts arrived in Hawaii.&nbsp; 
		For me, the space program has always captured an essential part of what 
		it means to be an American -- reaching for new heights, stretching 
		beyond what previously did not seem possible.&nbsp; And so, as President, I 
		believe that space exploration is not a luxury, it’s not an afterthought 
		in America’s quest for a brighter future -- it is an essential part of 
		that quest.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today, I’d like to talk 
		about the next chapter in this story.&nbsp; The challenges facing our space 
		program are different, and our imperatives for this program are 
		different, than in decades past.&nbsp; We’re no longer racing against an 
		adversary.&nbsp; We’re no longer competing to achieve a singular goal like 
		reaching the Moon.&nbsp; In fact, what was once a global competition has long 
		since become a global collaboration.&nbsp; But while the measure of our 
		achievements has changed a great deal over the past 50 years, what we do 
		-- or fail to do -- in seeking new frontiers is no less consequential 
		for our future in space and here on Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let me start by being 
		extremely clear:&nbsp; I am 100 percent committed to the mission of NASA and 
		its future.&nbsp; Because broadening our capabilities in space 
		will continue to serve our society in ways that we can scarcely 
		imagine.&nbsp; Because exploration will once more inspire wonder in a new 
		generation -- sparking passions and launching careers.&nbsp; And because, 
		ultimately, if we fail to press forward in the pursuit of discovery, we 
		are ceding our future and we are ceding that essential element of the 
		American character.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know there have been a 
		number of questions raised about my administration’s plan for space 
		exploration, especially in this part of Florida where so many rely on 
		NASA as a source of income as well as a source of pride and community.&nbsp; 
		And these questions come at a time of transition, as the space shuttle 
		nears its scheduled retirement after almost 30 years of service.&nbsp; And 
		understandably, this adds to the worries of folks concerned not only 
		about their own futures but about the future of the space program to 
		which they’ve devoted their lives.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I also know that 
		underlying these concerns is a deeper worry, one that precedes not only 
		this plan but this administration.&nbsp; It stems from the sense that people 
		in Washington -- driven sometimes less by vision than by politics -- 
		have for years neglected NASA’s mission and undermined the work of the 
		professionals who fulfill it.&nbsp; We’ve seen that in the NASA budget, which 
		has risen and fallen with the political winds.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we can also see it in 
		other ways:&nbsp; in the reluctance of those who hold office to set clear, 
		achievable objectives; to provide the resources to meet those 
		objectives; and to justify not just these plans but the larger purpose 
		of space exploration in the 21st century.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All that has to change.&nbsp; And 
		with the strategy I’m outlining today, it will.&nbsp; We start by increasing 
		NASA’s budget by $6 billion over the next five years, even -- I want people to understand the context of this.&nbsp; This is happening 
		even as we have instituted a freeze on discretionary spending and sought 
		to make cuts elsewhere in the budget.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So NASA, from the start, 
		several months ago when I issued my budget, was one of the areas where 
		we didn’t just maintain a freeze but we actually increased funding by $6 
		billion.&nbsp; By doing that we will ramp up robotic exploration of the solar 
		system, including a probe of the Sun’s atmosphere; new scouting missions 
		to Mars and other destinations; and an advanced telescope to follow 
		Hubble, allowing us to peer deeper into the universe than ever before.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will increase Earth-based 
		observation to improve our understanding of our climate and our world -- 
		science that will garner tangible benefits, helping us to protect our 
		environment for future generations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we will extend the life 
		of the International Space Station likely by more than five years, while 
		actually using it for its intended purpose:&nbsp; conducting advanced 
		research that can help improve the daily lives of people here on Earth, 
		as well as testing and improving upon our capabilities in space.&nbsp; 
		This includes technologies like more efficient life support systems that 
		will help reduce the cost of future missions.&nbsp; And in order to 
		reach the space station, we will work with a growing array of private 
		companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I recognize that some 
		have said it is unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in 
		this way.&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp; The truth is, NASA has always relied on private 
		industry to help design and build the vehicles that carry astronauts to 
		space, from the Mercury capsule that carried John Glenn into orbit 
		nearly 50 years ago, to the space shuttle Discovery currently orbiting 
		overhead.&nbsp; By buying the services of space transportation -- rather than 
		the vehicles themselves -- we can continue to ensure rigorous safety 
		standards are met.&nbsp; But we will also accelerate the pace of innovations 
		as companies -- from young startups to established leaders -- compete to 
		design and build and launch new means of carrying people and materials 
		out of our atmosphere.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition, as part of this 
		effort, we will build on the good work already done on the Orion crew 
		capsule.&nbsp; I’ve directed Charlie Bolden to immediately begin developing a 
		rescue vehicle using this technology, so we are not forced to rely on 
		foreign providers if it becomes necessary to quickly bring our people 
		home from the International Space Station.&nbsp; And this Orion effort will 
		be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be 
		used in future deep space missions.&nbsp; In fact, Orion will be readied for 
		flight right here in this room.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Next, we will invest more 
		than $3 billion to conduct research on an advanced “heavy lift rocket” 
		-- a vehicle to efficiently send into orbit the crew capsules, 
		propulsion systems, and large quantities of supplies needed to reach 
		deep space.&nbsp; In developing this new vehicle, we will not only look at 
		revising or modifying older models; we want to look at new designs, new 
		materials, new technologies that will transform not just where we can go 
		but what we can do when we get there.&nbsp; And we will finalize a rocket 
		design no later than 2015 and then begin to build it.&nbsp; And 
		I want everybody to understand:&nbsp; That’s at least two years earlier than 
		previously planned -- and that’s conservative, given that the previous 
		program was behind schedule and over budget.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time, after 
		decades of neglect, we will increase investment -- right away -- in 
		other groundbreaking technologies that will allow astronauts to reach 
		space sooner and more often, to travel farther and faster for less cost, 
		and to live and work in space for longer periods of time more safely.&nbsp; 
		That means tackling major scientific and technological challenges.&nbsp; How 
		do we shield astronauts from radiation on longer missions?&nbsp; How do we 
		harness resources on distant worlds?&nbsp; How do we supply spacecraft with 
		energy needed for these far-reaching journeys?&nbsp; These are questions that 
		we can answer and will answer.&nbsp; And these are the questions whose 
		answers no doubt will reap untold benefits right here on Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the point is what we’re 
		looking for is not just to continue on the same path -- we want to leap 
		into the future; we want major breakthroughs; a transformative agenda 
		for NASA.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, yes, pursuing this new 
		strategy will require that we revise the old strategy.&nbsp; In part, this is 
		because the old strategy -- including the Constellation program -- was 
		not fulfilling its promise in many ways.&nbsp; That’s not just my assessment; 
		that’s also the assessment of a panel of respected non-partisan experts 
		charged with looking at these issues closely.&nbsp; Now, despite this, some 
		have had harsh words for the decisions we’ve made, including some 
		individuals who I’ve got enormous respect and admiration for.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But what I hope is, is that 
		everybody will take a look at what we are planning, consider the details 
		of what we’ve laid out, and see the merits as I’ve described them.&nbsp; The 
		bottom line is nobody is more committed to manned space flight, to human 
		exploration of space than I am.&nbsp; But we’ve got to do it in 
		a smart way, and we can’t just keep on doing the same old things that 
		we’ve been doing and thinking that somehow is going to get us to where 
		we want to go.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some have said, for 
		instance, that this plan gives up our leadership in space by failing to 
		produce plans within NASA to reach low Earth orbit, instead of relying 
		on companies and other countries.&nbsp; But we will actually reach space 
		faster and more often under this new plan, in ways that will help us 
		improve our technological capacity and lower our costs, which are both 
		essential for the long-term sustainability of space flight.&nbsp; In fact, 
		through our plan, we’ll be sending many more astronauts to space over 
		the next decade.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are also those who 
		criticized our decision to end parts of Constellation as one that will 
		hinder space exploration below [sic] low Earth orbit.&nbsp; But it’s 
		precisely by investing in groundbreaking research and innovative 
		companies that we will have the potential to rapidly transform our 
		capabilities -- even as we build on the important work already 
		completed, through projects like Orion, for future missions.&nbsp; And unlike 
		the previous program, we are setting a course with specific and 
		achievable milestones.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Early in the next decade, a 
		set of crewed flights will test and prove the systems required for 
		exploration beyond low Earth orbit.&nbsp;And by 2025, we expect 
		new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the 
		first-ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space.&nbsp;So we’ll start -- we’ll start by sending astronauts to an 
		asteroid for the first time in history.&nbsp; By the mid-2030s, 
		I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to 
		Earth.&nbsp; And a landing on Mars will follow.&nbsp; And I expect to be around to 
		see it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I want to repeat -- I 
		want to repeat this:&nbsp; Critical to deep space exploration will be the 
		development of breakthrough propulsion systems and other advanced 
		technologies.&nbsp; So I’m challenging NASA to break through these barriers.&nbsp; 
		And we’ll give you the resources to break through these barriers.&nbsp; And I 
		know you will, with ingenuity and intensity, because that’s what you’ve 
		always done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I understand that some 
		believe that we should attempt a return to the surface of the Moon 
		first, as previously planned.&nbsp; But I just have to say pretty bluntly 
		here:&nbsp; We’ve been there before.&nbsp; Buzz has been there.&nbsp; There’s a lot 
		more of space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do.&nbsp; So I 
		believe it’s more important to ramp up our capabilities to reach -- and 
		operate at -- a series of increasingly demanding targets, while 
		advancing our technological capabilities with each step forward.&nbsp; And 
		that’s what this strategy does.&nbsp; And that’s how we will ensure that our 
		leadership in space is even stronger in this new century than it was in 
		the last.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, I want to say a few 
		words about jobs.&nbsp; Suzanne pointed out to me that the last time I was 
		here, I made a very clear promise that I would help in the transition 
		into a new program to make sure that people who are already going 
		through a tough time here in this region were helped.&nbsp; And despite some 
		reports to the contrary, my plan will add more than 2,500 jobs along the 
		Space Coast in the next two years compared to the plan under the 
		previous administration.&nbsp; So I want to make that point.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re going to modernize the 
		Kennedy Space Center, creating jobs as we upgrade launch facilities.&nbsp; 
		And there’s potential for even more jobs as companies in Florida and 
		across America compete to be part of a new space transportation 
		industry.&nbsp; And some of those industry leaders are here today.&nbsp; This 
		holds the promise of generating more than 10,000 jobs nationwide over 
		the next few years.&nbsp; And many of these jobs will be created right here 
		in Florida because this is an area primed to lead in this competition.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, it’s true -- there are 
		Floridians who will see their work on the shuttle end as the program 
		winds down.&nbsp; This is based on a decision that was made six years ago, 
		not six months ago, but that doesn’t make it any less painful for 
		families and communities affected as this decision becomes reality.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I’m proposing -- in part 
		because of strong lobbying by Bill and by Suzanne, as well as Charlie -- 
		I’m proposing a $40 million initiative led by a high-level team from the 
		White House, NASA, and other agencies to develop a plan for regional 
		economic growth and job creation.&nbsp; And I expect this plan to reach my 
		desk by August 15th.&nbsp;It’s an effort that will help prepare 
		this already skilled workforce for new opportunities in the space 
		industry and beyond.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is the next chapter 
		that we can write together here at NASA.&nbsp; We will partner with 
		industry.&nbsp; We will invest in cutting-edge research and technology.&nbsp; We 
		will set far-reaching milestones and provide the resources to reach 
		those milestones.&nbsp; And step by step, we will push the boundaries not 
		only of where we can go but what we can do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fifty years after the 
		creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach.&nbsp; 
		Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn and operate and 
		live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in 
		ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite.&nbsp; And in fulfilling 
		this task, we will not only extend humanity’s reach in space -- we will 
		strengthen America’s leadership here on Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I’ll close by saying 
		this.&nbsp; I know that some Americans have asked a question that’s 
		particularly apt on Tax Day:&nbsp; Why spend money on NASA at all?&nbsp; Why spend 
		money solving problems in space when we don’t lack for problems to solve 
		here on the ground?&nbsp; And obviously our country is still reeling from the 
		worst economic turmoil we’ve known in generations.&nbsp; We have massive 
		structural deficits that have to be closed in the coming years.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But you and I know this is a 
		false choice.&nbsp; We have to fix our economy.&nbsp; We need to close our 
		deficits.&nbsp; But for pennies on the dollar, the space program has fueled 
		jobs and entire industries.&nbsp; For pennies on the dollar, the space 
		program has improved our lives, advanced our society, strengthened our 
		economy, and inspired generations of Americans.&nbsp; And I have no doubt 
		that NASA can continue to fulfill this role.&nbsp;But that is 
		why -- but I want to say clearly to those of you who work for NASA, but 
		to the entire community that has been so supportive of the space program 
		in this area:&nbsp; That is exactly why it’s so essential that we pursue a 
		new course and that we revitalize NASA and its mission -- not just with 
		dollars, but with clear aims and a larger purpose.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, little more than 40 
		years ago, astronauts descended the nine-rung ladder of the lunar module 
		called Eagle, and allowed their feet to touch the dusty surface of the 
		Earth’s only Moon.&nbsp; This was the culmination of a daring and perilous 
		gambit -- of an endeavor that pushed the boundaries of our knowledge, of 
		our technological prowess, of our very capacity as human beings to solve 
		problems.&nbsp; It wasn’t just the greatest achievement in NASA’s history -- 
		it was one of the greatest achievements in human history.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the question for us now 
		is whether that was the beginning of something or the end of something.&nbsp; 
		I choose to believe it was only the beginning.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So thank you.&nbsp; God bless 
		you.&nbsp; And may God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.</font></p>
