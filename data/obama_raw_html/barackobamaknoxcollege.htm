			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning President 
			Taylor, Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, the 
			community of Galesburg, the class of 1955 -- which I understand was 
			out partying last night, and yet still showed up here on time -- and 
			most of all, the Class of 2005. Congratulations on your graduation, 
			and thank you -- thank you for the honor of allowing me to be a part of it. Thank 
			you also, Mr. President, for this honorary degree. It was only a 
			couple of years ago that I stopped paying my student loans in law 
			school. Had I known it was this easy, I would have ran [sic] for the 
			United States Senate earlier.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, it has been 
			about six months now since you sent me to Washington as your United 
			States Senator. I recognize that not all of you voted for me, so for 
			those of you muttering under your breath &quot;I didn’t send you 
			anywhere,&quot; that's ok too. Maybe we’ll hold -- What do you call it? -- 
			a little Pumphandle after the ceremony. Change your mind for the next 
			time.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been a 
			fascinating journey thus far. Each time I walk onto the Senate 
			floor, I'm reminded of the history, for good and for ill, that has 
			been made there. But there have been a few surreal moments. For 
			example, I remember the day before I was sworn in, myself and my 
			staff, we decided to hold a press conference in our office. Now, 
			keep in mind that I am ranked 99th in seniority. I was proud that I 
			wasn’t ranked dead last until I found out that it’s just because 
			Illinois is bigger than Colorado. So I’m 99th in seniority, and all 
			the reporters are crammed into the tiny transition office that I 
			have, which is right next to the janitor’s closet in the basement of 
			the Dirksen Office Building. It’s my first day in the building, I 
			have not taken a single vote, I have not introduced one bill, had 
			not even sat down in my desk, and this very earnest reporter raises 
			his hand and says:</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">“Senator Obama, what is 
			your place in history?”</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I did what you just did, 
			which is laugh out loud. I said, &quot;place in history?&quot; I thought he was 
			kidding. At that point, I wasn’t even sure the other Senators would 
			save a place for me at the cool kids’ table.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But as I was thinking 
			about the words to share with this class, about what’s next, about 
			what’s possible, and what opportunities lay ahead, I actually think 
			it’s not a bad question for you, the class of 2005, to ask 
			yourselves: What will be your place 
			in history?</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In other eras, across 
			distant lands, this question could be answered with relative ease 
			and certainty. As a servant in Rome, you knew you’d spend your life 
			forced to build somebody else’s Empire. As a peasant in 11th Century 
			China, you knew that no matter how hard you worked, the local 
			warlord might come and take everything you had -- and you also knew 
			that famine might come knocking at the door. As a subject of King 
			George, you knew that your freedom of worship and your freedom to 
			speak and to build your own life would be ultimately limited by the 
			throne.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then America 
			happened.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A place where destiny 
			was not a destination, but a journey to be shared and shaped and 
			remade by people who had the gall, the temerity to believe that, 
			against all odds, they could form “a more perfect union” on this new 
			frontier.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as people around the 
			world began to hear the tale of the lowly colonists who overthrew an 
			empire for the sake of an idea, they started to come. Across oceans 
			and the ages, they settled in Boston and Charleston, Chicago and St. 
			Louis, Kalamazoo and Galesburg, to try and build their own American 
			Dream. This collective dream moved forward imperfectly -- it was 
			scarred by our treatment of native peoples, betrayed by slavery, 
			clouded by the subjugation of women, shaken by war and depression. 
			And yet, brick by brick, rail by rail, calloused hand by calloused 
			hand, people kept dreaming, and building, and working, and marching, 
			and petitioning their government, until they made America a land 
			where the question of our place in history is not answered for us. 
			It’s answered by us.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Have we failed at times? 
			Absolutely. Will you occasionally fail when you embark on your own 
			American journey? You surely will. But the test is not perfection.<br>
			The true test of the American ideal is whether we’re able to 
			recognize our failings and then rise together to meet the challenges 
			of our time. Whether we allow ourselves to be shaped by events and 
			history, or whether we act to shape them. Whether chance of birth or 
			circumstance decides life’s big winners and losers, or whether we 
			build a community where, at the very least, everyone has a chance to 
			work hard, get ahead, and reach their dreams.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have faced this 
			choice before.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the end of the Civil 
			War, when farmers and their families began moving into the cities to 
			work in the big factories that were sprouting up all across America, 
			we had to decide:&nbsp; Do we do nothing and allow captains of industry 
			and robber barons to run roughshod over the economy and workers by 
			competing to see who can pay the lowest wages at the worst working 
			conditions? Or do we try to make the system work by setting up basic 
			rules for the market, instituting the first&nbsp;public schools, busting 
			up monopolies, letting workers organize into unions?</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We chose to act, and we 
			rose together.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When the irrational 
			exuberance of the Roaring Twenties came crashing down with the stock 
			market, we had to decide: do we follow the call of leaders who would 
			do nothing, or the call of a leader who, perhaps because of his 
			physical paralysis, refused to accept political paralysis?</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We chose to 
			act -- regulating the market, putting people back to work, expanding 
			bargaining rights to include health care and a secure retirement -- and 
			together we rose.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When World War II 
			required the most massive home front mobilization in history and we 
			needed every single American to lend a hand, we had to decide:&nbsp;Do we 
			listen to skeptics who told us it wasn’t possible to produce that 
			many tanks and planes? Or, did we build Roosevelt’s Arsenal for 
			Democracy and grow our economy even further by providing our 
			returning heroes with a chance to go to college and own their own 
			home?</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, we chose to act, 
			and again, we rose together.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, at the beginning 
			of this young century, we have to decide again. But this time, it is 
			your turn to choose.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here in Galesburg, you 
			know what this new challenge is. You’ve seen it.
			All of you, your first year in college saw what happened at 9/11. 
			It’s already been noted, the degree to which your lives will be 
			intertwined with the war on terrorism that currently is taking 
			place. But what you’ve also seen, perhaps not as spectacularly, is 
			the fact that when you drive by the old Maytag plant around 
			lunchtime, no one walks out anymore. I saw it during the campaign 
			when I met union guys who worked at the plant for 20, 30 years and 
			now wonder what they’re gonna do at the age of 55 without a pension 
			or health care; when I met the man who’s son needed a new liver but 
			because he’d been laid off, didn’t know if he could afford to 
			provide his child the care that he needed.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s as if someone 
			changed the rules in the middle of the game and no wonder -- no one bothered to 
			tell these folks. And, in reality, the rules have changed.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It started with 
			technology and automation that rendered entire occupations obsolete. 
			When was the last time anybody here stood in line for the bank 
			teller instead of going to the ATM, or talked to a switchboard 
			operator? Then it continued when companies like Maytag were able to 
			pick up and move their factories to some under developed country 
			where workers were a lot cheaper than they are in the United States.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Tom Friedman points 
			out in his new book, <i>The World Is Flat</i>, over the last decade or so, 
			these forces -- technology and globalization -- have combined like 
			never before. So that while most of us have been paying attention to 
			how much easier technology has made our own lives -- sending e-mails 
			back and forth on our blackberries, surfing the Web on our cell 
			phones, instant messaging with friends across the world -- a quiet 
			revolution has been breaking down barriers and connecting the 
			world’s economies. Now business not only has the ability to move 
			jobs wherever there’s a factory, but wherever there’s an internet 
			connection.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Countries like India and 
			China realized this. They understand that they no longer need to be 
			just a source of cheap labor or cheap exports. They can compete with 
			us on a global scale. The one resource they needed were skilled, 
			educated workers. So they started schooling their kids earlier, 
			longer, with a greater emphasis on math and science and technology, 
			until their most talented students realized they don’t have to come 
			to America to have a decent life -- they can stay right where they 
			are.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The result? China is 
			graduating four times the number of engineers that the United States 
			is graduating. Not only are those Maytag employees competing with 
			Chinese and Indian and Indonesian and Mexican workers, you are too. 
			Today, accounting firms are e-mailing your tax returns to workers in 
			India who will figure them out and send them back to you as fast as 
			any worker in Illinois or Indiana could.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When you lose your 
			luggage in Boston at an airport, tracking it down may involve a call 
			to an agent in Bangalore, who will find it by making a phone call to 
			Baltimore. Even the Associated Press has outsourced some of their 
			jobs to writers all over the world who can send in a story at a 
			click of a mouse.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Prime Minister Tony 
			Blair has said, in this new economy, &quot;Talent is the 21st century 
			wealth.&quot;&nbsp; If you've got the skills, you've got the education, and 
			you have the opportunity to upgrade and improve both, you’ll be able 
			to compete and win anywhere. If not, the fall will be further and 
			harder than it ever was before.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what do we do about this?&nbsp;How does America find its way in this 
			new, global economy?&nbsp;What will our place in history be?</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
			Like so much of the 
			American story, once again, we face a choice. Once again, there are 
			those who believe that there isn’t much we can do about this as a 
			nation. That the best idea is to give everyone one big refund on 
			their government -- divvy it up by individual portions, in the form 
			of tax breaks, hand it out, and encourage everyone to use their 
			share to go buy their own health care, their own retirement plan, 
			their own child care, their own education, and so on.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Washington, they call 
			this the Ownership Society. But in our past there has been another 
			term for it -- Social Darwinism -- every man or woman for him or 
			herself. It’s a tempting idea, because it doesn’t require much 
			thought or ingenuity. It allows us to say that those whose health 
			care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford -- tough luck. 
			It allows us to say to the Maytag workers who have lost their job -- 
			life isn’t fair. It let’s us say to the child who was born into 
			poverty -- pull yourself up by your bootstraps. And it is especially 
			tempting because each of us believes we will always be the winner in 
			life’s lottery, that we’re the one who will be the next Donald 
			Trump, or at least we won’t be the chump who Donald Trump says: 
			“You’re fired!”</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there is a problem. 
			It won’t work. It ignores our history. It ignores the fact that it’s 
			been government research and investment that made the railways 
			possible and the internet possible. It’s been the creation of a 
			massive middle class, through decent wages and benefits and public 
			schools that allowed us all to prosper. Our economic dependence 
			depended on individual initiative. It depended on a belief in the 
			free market; but it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard 
			for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, 
			that we’re all in it together and everybody’s got a shot at 
			opportunity. That’s what’s produced our unrivaled political 
			stability.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so if we do nothing 
			in the face of globalization, more people will continue to lose 
			their health care. Fewer kids will be able to afford the diploma 
			you’re about to receive.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">More companies like 
			United Airlines won’t be able to provide pensions for their 
			employees. And those Maytag workers will be joined in the 
			unemployment line by any worker whose skills can be bought and sold 
			on the global market.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today I’m here to 
			tell you what most of you already know. This is not us -- the option 
			that I just mentioned. Doing nothing. It’s not how our story ends -- 
			not in this country. America is a land of big dreamers and big 
			hopes.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is this hope that has 
			sustained us through revolution and civil war, depression and world 
			war, a struggle for civil and social rights and the brink of nuclear 
			crisis. And it is because our dreamers dreamed that we have emerged 
			from each challenge more united, more prosperous, and more admired 
			than before.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let’s dream. Instead 
			of doing nothing or simply defending 20th century solutions, let’s 
			imagine together what we could do to give every American a fighting 
			chance in the 21st century.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What if we prepared 
			every child in America with the education and skills they need to 
			compete in the new economy?&nbsp; If we made sure that college was 
			affordable for everyone who wanted to go? If we walked up to those 
			Maytag workers and we said “Your old job is not coming back, but a 
			new job will be there because we’re going to seriously retrain you 
			and there’s life-long education that’s waiting for you -- the sorts 
			of opportunities that Knox has created with the Strong Futures 
			scholarship program.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What if no matter where 
			you worked or how many times you switched jobs, you had health care 
			and a pension that stayed with you always, so you all had the 
			flexibility to move to a better job or start a new business? What if 
			instead of cutting budgets for research and development and science, 
			we fueled the genius and the innovation that will lead to the new 
			jobs and new industries of the future?</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Right now, all across 
			America, there are amazing discoveries being made. If we supported 
			these discoveries on a national level, if we committed ourselves to 
			investing in these possibilities, just imagine what it could do for 
			a town like Galesburg. Ten or twenty years down the road, that old 
			Maytag plant could re-open its doors as an Ethanol refinery that 
			turned corn into fuel. Down the street, a biotechnology research lab 
			could open up on the cusp of discovering a cure for cancer. And 
			across the way, a new auto company could be busy churning out 
			electric cars. The new jobs created would be filled by American 
			workers trained with new skills and a world-class education.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of that is possible 
			but none of it will come easy. Every one of us is going to have to 
			work more, read more, train more, think more. We will have to slough 
			off some bad habits -- like driving gas guzzlers that weaken our 
			economy and feed our enemies abroad. Our children will have to turn 
			off the TV set once in a while and put away the video games and 
			start hitting the books. We’ll have to reform institutions, like our 
			public schools, that were designed for an earlier time. Republicans 
			will have to recognize our collective responsibilities, even as 
			Democrats recognize that we have to do more than just defend old 
			programs.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It won’t be easy, but it 
			can be done. It can be our future. We have the talent and the 
			resources and brainpower. But now we need the political will. We 
			need a national commitment.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we need each of you.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, no one can force 
			you to meet these challenges. If you want, it will be pretty easy 
			for you to leave here today and not give another thought to towns 
			like Galesburg and the challenges they face. There is no community 
			service requirement in the real world; no one is forcing you to 
			care. You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing 
			after the big house, and the nice suits, and all the other things 
			that our money culture says that you should want, that you should 
			aspire to, that you can buy.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I hope you don’t 
			walk away from the challenge. Focusing your life solely on making a 
			buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of 
			yourself. You need to take up the challenges that we face as a 
			nation and make them your own. Not because you have a debt to those 
			who helped you get here, although you do have that debt. Not because 
			you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate than you, 
			although I do think you do have that obligation. It’s primarily 
			because you have an obligation to yourself. Because individual 
			salvation has always depended on collective salvation. Because it’s 
			only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself 
			that you realize your true potential.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I know that all of 
			you are wondering how you’ll do this, the challenges seem so big. 
			They seem so difficult for one person to make a difference.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we know it can be 
			done. Because where you’re sitting, in this very place, in this 
			town, it’s happened before.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nearly two centuries 
			ago, before civil rights, before voting rights, before Abraham 
			Lincoln, before the Civil War, before all of that, America was 
			stained by the sin of slavery. In the sweltering heat of southern 
			plantations, men and women who looked like me could not escape the 
			life of pain and servitude in which they were sold. And yet, year 
			after year, as this moral cancer ate away at the American ideals of 
			liberty and equality, the nation was silent.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But its people didn’t 
			stay silent for long.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One by one, 
			abolitionists emerged to tell their fellow Americans that this would 
			not be our place in history -- that this was not the America that had 
			captured the imagination of the world.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This resistance that 
			they met was fierce, and some paid with their lives. But they would 
			not be deterred, and they soon spread out across the country to 
			fight for their cause. One man from New York went west, all the way 
			to the prairies of Illinois to start a colony.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And here in Galesburg, 
			freedom found a home.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here in Galesburg, the 
			main depot for the Underground Railroad in Illinois, escaped slaves 
			could roam freely on the streets and take shelter in people’s homes. 
			And when their masters or the police would come for them, the people 
			of this town would help them escape north, some literally carrying 
			them in their arms to freedom.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Think about the risks 
			that involved. If they were caught abetting a fugitive, you could’ve 
			been jailed or lynched. It would have been simple for these 
			townspeople to turn the other way; to go live their lives in a 
			private peace.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, they didn’t do 
			that. Why?</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because they knew that 
			we were all Americans; that we were all brothers and sisters; the 
			same reason that a century later, young men and women your age would 
			take Freedom Rides down south, to work for the Civil Rights 
			movement. The same reason that black women would walk instead of 
			ride a bus after a long day of doing somebody else’s laundry and 
			cleaning somebody else’s kitchen. Because they were marching for 
			freedom.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, on this day of 
			possibility, we stand in the shadow of a lanky, raw-boned man with 
			little formal education who once took the stage at Old Main and told 
			the nation that if anyone did not believe the American principles of 
			freedom and equality, that those principles were timeless and 
			all-inclusive, they should go rip that page out of the Declaration 
			of Independence.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My hope for all of you 
			is that as you leave here today, you decide to keep these principles 
			alive in your own life and in the life of this country. You will be 
			tested. You won’t always succeed. But know that you have it within 
			your power to try. That generations who have come before you faced 
			these same fears and uncertainties in their own time. And that 
			through our collective labor, and through God’s providence, and our 
			willingness to shoulder each other’s burdens, America will continue 
			on its precious journey towards that distant horizon, and a better 
			day.</font></p>
			<p align="left" style="line-height: 130%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much class 
			of 2005, and congratulations on your graduation. Thank you.</font></p>
