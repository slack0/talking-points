&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning.&nbsp; Praise be to 
		God.&nbsp; Let me begin by thanking the entire Vermont Avenue Baptist Church 
		family for welcoming our family here today.&nbsp; It feels like a family.&nbsp; 
		Thank you for making us feel that way.&nbsp; To Pastor Wheeler, first lady 
		Wheeler, thank you so much for welcoming us here today.&nbsp; Congratulations 
		on Jordan Denice -- aka Cornelia.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Michelle and I have been 
		blessed with a new nephew this year as well -- Austin Lucas Robinson.&nbsp; 
		So maybe at the appropriate time we can make introductions.&nbsp;Now, if 
		Jordan's father is like me, then that will be in about 30 years. That is 
		a great blessing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Michelle and Malia and Sasha 
		and I are thrilled to be here today.&nbsp; And I know that sometimes you have 
		to go through a little fuss to have me as a guest speaker.&nbsp;So let me 
		apologize in advance for all the fuss. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We gather here, on a 
		Sabbath, during a time of profound difficulty for our nation and for our 
		world.&nbsp; In such a time, it soothes the soul to seek out the Divine in a 
		spirit of prayer; to seek solace among a community of believers.&nbsp; But we 
		are not here just to ask the Lord for His blessing.&nbsp; We aren't here just 
		to interpret His Scripture.&nbsp; We're also here to call on the memory of 
		one of His noble servants, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, it's fitting that we do 
		so here, within the four walls of Vermont Avenue Baptist Church -- here, 
		in a church that rose like the phoenix from the ashes of the civil war; 
		here in a church formed by freed slaves, whose founding pastor had worn 
		the union blue; here in a church from whose pews congregants set out for 
		marches and from whom choir anthems of freedom were heard; from whose 
		sanctuary King himself would sermonize from time to time. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of those times was 
		Thursday, December 6, 1956.&nbsp; Pastor, you said you were a little older 
		than me, so were you around at that point?&nbsp;You were three 
		years old -- okay.&nbsp;I wasn’t born yet.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		On Thursday, December 6, 1956.&nbsp; And before Dr. King had pointed us to 
		the mountaintop, before he told us about his dream in front of the 
		Lincoln Memorial, King came here, as a 27-year-old preacher, to speak on 
		what he called &quot;The Challenge of a New Age.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;The Challenge of a New 
		Age.&quot;&nbsp; It was a period of triumph, but also uncertainty, for Dr. King 
		and his followers -- because just weeks earlier, the Supreme Court had 
		ordered the desegregation of Montgomery's buses, a hard-wrought, 
		hard-fought victory that would put an end to the 381-day historic 
		boycott down in Montgomery, Alabama. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, as Dr. King rose to 
		take that pulpit, the future still seemed daunting.&nbsp; It wasn't clear 
		what would come next for the movement that Dr. King led.&nbsp; It wasn't 
		clear how we were going to reach the Promised Land.&nbsp; Because segregation 
		was still rife; lynchings still a fact.&nbsp; Yes, the Supreme Court had 
		ruled not only on the Montgomery buses, but also on Brown v. Board of 
		Education.&nbsp; And yet that ruling was defied throughout the South -- by 
		schools and by states; they ignored it with impunity.&nbsp; And here in the 
		nation's capital, the federal government had yet to fully align itself 
		with the laws on its books and the ideals of its founding.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So it's not hard for us, 
		then, to imagine that moment.&nbsp; We can imagine folks coming to this 
		church, happy about the boycott being over.&nbsp; We can also imagine them, 
		though, coming here concerned about their future, sometimes 
		second-guessing strategy, maybe fighting off some creeping doubts, 
		perhaps despairing about whether the movement in which they had placed 
		so many of their hopes -- a movement in which they believed so deeply -- 
		could actually deliver on its promise. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So here we are, more than 
		half a century later, once again facing the challenges of a new age.&nbsp; 
		Here we are, once more marching toward an unknown future, what I call 
		the Joshua generation to their Moses generation -- the great inheritors 
		of progress paid for with sweat and blood, and sometimes life itself.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've inherited the progress 
		of unjust laws that are now overturned.&nbsp; We take for granted the 
		progress of a ballot being available to anybody who wants to take the 
		time to actually vote. We enjoy the fruits of prejudice and bigotry 
		being lifted -- slowly, sometimes in fits and starts, but irrevocably -- 
		from human hearts.&nbsp; It's that progress that made it possible for me to 
		be here today; for the good people of this country to elect an African 
		American the 44th President of the United States of America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reverend Wheeler mentioned 
		the inauguration, last year's election.&nbsp; You know, on the heels of that 
		victory over a year ago, there were some who suggested that somehow we 
		had entered into a post-racial America, all those problems would be 
		solved.&nbsp; There were those who argued that because I had spoke of a need 
		for unity in this country that our nation was somehow entering into a 
		period of post-partisanship.&nbsp; That didn’t work out so well.&nbsp; There was a 
		hope shared by many that life would be better from the moment that I 
		swore that oath. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, as we meet here 
		today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment has not yet 
		been fully fulfilled.&nbsp; Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility 
		that sowed the seeds of its own demise, because of persistent economic 
		troubles unaddressed through the generations, because of a banking 
		crisis that brought the financial system to the brink of catastrophe, we 
		are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have been 
		tested before. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unemployment is at its 
		highest level in more than a quarter of a century.&nbsp; Nowhere is it higher 
		than the African American community.&nbsp; Poverty is on the rise.&nbsp; Home 
		ownership is slipping. Beyond our shores, our sons and daughters are 
		fighting two wars. Closer to home, our Haitian brothers and sisters are 
		in desperate need.&nbsp; Bruised, battered, many people are legitimately 
		feeling doubt, even despair, about the future.&nbsp; Like those who came to 
		this church on that Thursday in 1956, folks are wondering, where do we 
		go from here? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I understand those 
		feelings.&nbsp; I understand the frustration and sometimes anger that so many 
		folks feel as they struggle to stay afloat.&nbsp; I get letters from folks 
		around the country every day; I read 10 a night out of the 40,000 that 
		we receive.&nbsp; And there are stories of hardship and desperation, in some 
		cases, pleading for help:&nbsp; I need a job.&nbsp; I'm about to lose my home.&nbsp; I 
		don't have health care -- it's about to cause my family to be bankrupt.&nbsp; 
		Sometimes you get letters from children:&nbsp; My mama or my daddy have lost 
		their jobs, is there something you can do to help?&nbsp; Ten letters like 
		that a day we read.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, yes, we're passing 
		through a hard winter.&nbsp; It's the hardest in some time.&nbsp; But let's always 
		remember that, as a people, the American people, we've weathered some 
		hard winters before.&nbsp; This country was founded during some harsh 
		winters.&nbsp; The fishermen, the laborers, the craftsmen who made camp at 
		Valley Forge -- they weathered a hard winter.&nbsp; The slaves and the 
		freedmen who rode an underground railroad, seeking the light of justice 
		under the cover of night -- they weathered a hard winter. The seamstress 
		whose feet were tired, the pastor whose voice echoes through the ages -- 
		they weathered some hard winters.&nbsp; It was for them, as it is for us, 
		difficult, in the dead of winter, to sometimes see spring coming.&nbsp; They, 
		too, sometimes felt their hopes deflate.&nbsp; And yet, each season, the 
		frost melts, the cold recedes, the sun reappears.&nbsp; So it was for earlier 
		generations and so it will be for us. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What we need to do is to 
		just ask what lessons we can learn from those earlier generations about 
		how they sustained themselves during those hard winters, how they 
		persevered and prevailed.&nbsp; Let us in this Joshua generation learn how 
		that Moses generation overcame.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me offer a few thoughts 
		on this.&nbsp; First and foremost, they did so by remaining firm in their 
		resolve.&nbsp; Despite being threatened by sniper fire or planted bombs, by 
		shoving and punching and spitting and angry stares, they adhered to that 
		sweet spirit of resistance, the principles of nonviolence that had 
		accounted for their success. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, they understood that 
		as much as our government and our political parties had betrayed them in 
		the past -- as much as our nation itself had betrayed its own ideals -- 
		government, if aligned with the interests of its people, can be -- and 
		must be&nbsp; -- a force for good.&nbsp; So they stayed on the Justice 
		Department.&nbsp; They went into the courts.&nbsp; They pressured Congress, they 
		pressured their President.&nbsp; They didn’t give up on this country. They 
		didn’t give up on government.&nbsp; They didn’t somehow say government was 
		the problem; they said, we're going to change government, we're going to 
		make it better.&nbsp; Imperfect as it was, they continued to believe in the 
		promise of democracy; in America's constant ability to remake itself, to 
		perfect this union. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, our predecessors were 
		never so consumed with theoretical debates that they couldn't see 
		progress when it came. Sometimes I get a little frustrated when folks 
		just don't want to see that even if we don't get everything, we're 
		getting something.&nbsp;King understood that the desegregation 
		of the Armed Forces didn’t end the civil rights movement, because black 
		and white soldiers still couldn't sit together at the same lunch counter 
		when they came home.&nbsp; But he still insisted on the rightness of 
		desegregating the Armed Forces.&nbsp; That was a good first step -- even as 
		he called for more.&nbsp; He didn’t suggest that somehow by the signing of 
		the Civil Rights that somehow all discrimination would end.&nbsp; But he also 
		didn’t think that we shouldn’t sign the Civil Rights Act because it 
		hasn’t solved every problem.&nbsp; Let's take a victory, he said, and then 
		keep on marching.&nbsp; Forward steps, large and small, were recognized for 
		what they were -- which was progress. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fourth, at the core of 
		King's success was an appeal to conscience that touched hearts and 
		opened minds, a commitment to universal ideals -- of freedom, of 
		justice, of equality -- that spoke to all people, not just some people.&nbsp; 
		For King understood that without broad support, any movement for civil 
		rights could not be sustained.&nbsp; That's why he marched with the white 
		auto worker in Detroit.&nbsp; That's why he linked arm with the Mexican farm 
		worker in California, and united people of all colors in the noble quest 
		for freedom. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, King overcame in 
		other ways as well.&nbsp; He remained strategically focused on gaining ground 
		-- his eyes on the prize constantly -- understanding that change would 
		not be easy, understand that change wouldn't come overnight, 
		understanding that there would be setbacks and false starts along the 
		way, but understanding, as he said in 1956, that &quot;we can walk and never 
		get weary, because we know there is a great camp meeting in the promised 
		land of freedom and justice.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it's because the Moses 
		generation overcame that the trials we face today are very different 
		from the ones that tested us in previous generations.&nbsp; Even after the 
		worst recession in generations, life in America is not even close to 
		being as brutal as it was back then for so many.&nbsp; That's the legacy of 
		Dr. King and his movement.&nbsp; That's our inheritance.&nbsp; Having said that, 
		let there be no doubt the challenges of our new age are serious in their 
		own right, and we must face them as squarely as they faced the 
		challenges they saw. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know it's been a hard road 
		we've traveled this year to rescue the economy, but the economy is 
		growing again.&nbsp; The job losses have finally slowed, and around the 
		country, there's signs that businesses and families are beginning to 
		rebound.&nbsp; We are making progress.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know it's been a hard road 
		that we've traveled to reach this point on health reform.&nbsp; I promise you 
		I know.&nbsp; But under the legislation I will sign into law, insurance 
		companies won't be able to drop you when you get sick, and more than 30 
		million people -- our fellow Americans will finally have insurance.&nbsp; 
		More than 30 million men and women and children, mothers and fathers, 
		won't be worried about what might happen to them if they get sick.&nbsp; This 
		will be a victory not for Democrats; this will be a victory for dignity 
		and decency, for our common humanity.&nbsp; This will be a victory for the 
		United States of America. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let's work to change the 
		political system, as imperfect as it is.&nbsp; I know people can feel down 
		about the way things are going sometimes here in Washington.&nbsp; I know 
		it's tempting to give up on the political process.&nbsp; But we've put in 
		place tougher rules on lobbying and ethics and transparency -- tougher 
		rules than any administration in history.&nbsp; It's not enough, but it's 
		progress.&nbsp; Progress is possible.&nbsp; Don't give up on voting.&nbsp; Don't give 
		up on advocacy.&nbsp; Don't give up on activism.&nbsp; There are too many needs to 
		be met, too much work to be done.&nbsp; Like Dr. King said, &quot;We must accept 
		finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us broaden our 
		coalition, building a confederation not of liberals or conservatives, 
		not of red states or blue states, but of all Americans who are hurting 
		today, and searching for a better tomorrow.&nbsp; The urgency of the hour 
		demands that we make common cause with all of America's workers -- 
		white, black, brown -- all of whom are being hammered by this recession, 
		all of whom are yearning for that spring to come.&nbsp; It demands that we 
		reach out to those who've been left out in the cold even when the 
		economy is good, even when we're not in recession -- the youth in the 
		inner cities, the youth here in Washington, D.C., people in rural 
		communities who haven't seen prosperity reach them for a very long 
		time.&nbsp; It demands that we fight discrimination, whatever form it may 
		come.&nbsp; That means we fight discrimination&nbsp; against gays and lesbians, 
		and we make common cause to reform our immigration system.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamamlkremembrance2.JPG" width="290" height="181">
		And finally, we have to recognize, as Dr. King did, that progress can't 
		just come from without -- it also has to come from within.&nbsp; And over the 
		past year, for example, we've made meaningful improvements in the field 
		of education.&nbsp; I've got a terrific Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan.&nbsp; 
		He's been working hard with states and working hard with the D.C. school 
		district, and we've insisted on reform, and we've insisted on 
		accountability.&nbsp; We we're putting in more money and we've provided more 
		Pell Grants and more tuition tax credits and simpler financial aid 
		forms.&nbsp; We've done all that, but parents still need to parent.&nbsp; Kids 
		still need to own up to their responsibilities.&nbsp; We still have to set 
		high expectations for our young people.&nbsp; Folks can't simply look to 
		government for all the answers without also looking inside themselves, 
		inside their own homes, for some of the answers. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Progress will only come if 
		we're willing to promote that ethic of hard work, a sense of 
		responsibility, in our own lives. I'm not talking, by the way, just to 
		the African American community.&nbsp; Sometimes when I say these things 
		people assme, well, he's just talking to black people about working 
		hard.&nbsp; No, no, no, no.&nbsp; I'm talking to the American community.&nbsp; Because 
		somewhere along the way, we, as a nation, began to lose touch with some 
		of our core values.&nbsp; You know what I'm talking about.&nbsp; We became 
		enraptured with the false prophets who prophesized an easy path to 
		success, paved with credit cards and home equity loans and 
		get-rich-quick schemes, and the most important thing was to be a 
		celebrity; it doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you get on TV.&nbsp; 
		That's everybody. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We forgot what made the bus 
		boycott a success; what made the civil rights movement a success; what 
		made the United States of America a success -- that, in this country, 
		there's no substitute for hard work, no substitute for a job well done, 
		no substitute for being responsible stewards of God's blessings. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What we're called to do, 
		then, is rebuild America from its foundation on up.&nbsp; To reinvest in the 
		essentials that we've neglected for too long -- like health care, like 
		education, like a better energy policy, like basic infrastructure, like 
		scientific research.&nbsp; Our generation is called to buckle down and get 
		back to basics. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We must do so not only for 
		ourselves, but also for our children, and their children.&nbsp; For Jordan 
		and for Austin.&nbsp; That's a sacrifice that falls on us to make.&nbsp; It's a 
		much smaller sacrifice than the Moses generation had to make, but it's 
		still a sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, it's hard to transition 
		to a clean energy economy.&nbsp; Sometimes it may be inconvenient, but it's a 
		sacrifice that we have to make.&nbsp; It's hard to be fiscally responsible 
		when we have all these human needs, and we're inheriting enormous 
		deficits and debt, but that's a sacrifice that we're going to have to 
		make.&nbsp; You know, it's easy, after a hard day's work, to just put your 
		kid in front of the TV set -- you're tired, don't want to fuss with them 
		-- instead of reading to them, but that's a sacrifice we must joyfully 
		accept.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sometimes it's hard to be a 
		good father and good mother. Sometimes it's hard to be a good neighbor, 
		or a good citizen, to give up time in service of others, to give 
		something of ourselves to a cause that's greater than ourselves -- as 
		Michelle and I are urging folks to do tomorrow to honor and celebrate 
		Dr. King.&nbsp; But these are sacrifices that we are called to make.&nbsp; These 
		are sacrifices that our faith calls us to make.&nbsp; Our faith in the 
		future.&nbsp; Our faith in America.&nbsp; Our faith in God.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And on his sermon all those 
		years ago, Dr. King quoted a poet's verse: </font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Truth forever on the 
		scaffold<br>Wrong forever on the throne…<br>And behind the dim unknown stands God<br>Within the shadows keeping watch above his own. 
			</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even as Dr. King stood in 
		this church, a victory in the past and uncertainty in the future, he 
		trusted God.&nbsp; He trusted that God would make a way.&nbsp; A way for prayers 
		to be answered.&nbsp; A way for our union to be perfected.&nbsp; A way for the arc 
		of the moral universe, no matter how long, to slowly bend towards truth 
		and bend towards freedom, to bend towards justice.&nbsp; He had faith that 
		God would make a way out of no way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, folks ask me 
		sometimes why I look so calm.&nbsp;They say, all this stuff coming at you, 
		how come you just seem calm?&nbsp; And I have a confession to make here.&nbsp; 
		There are times where I'm not so calm.&nbsp;Reggie Love knows.&nbsp; My wife 
		knows.&nbsp; There are times when progress seems too slow.&nbsp; There are times 
		when the words that are spoken about me hurt.&nbsp; There are times when the 
		barbs sting.&nbsp; There are times when it feels like all these efforts are 
		for naught, and change is so painfully slow in coming, and I have to 
		confront my own doubts.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But let me tell you -- 
		during those times it's faith that keeps me calm.&nbsp;It's faith that gives 
		me peace.&nbsp; The same faith that leads a single mother to work two jobs to 
		put a roof over her head when she has doubts.&nbsp; The same faith that keeps 
		an unemployed father to keep on submitting job applications even after 
		he's been rejected a hundred times.&nbsp; The same faith that says to a 
		teacher even if the first nine children she's teaching she can't reach, 
		that that 10th one she's going to be able to reach.&nbsp; The same faith that 
		breaks the silence of an earthquake's wake with the sound of prayers and 
		hymns sung by a Haitian community.&nbsp; A faith in things not seen, in 
		better days ahead, in Him who holds the future in the hollow of His 
		hand.&nbsp; A faith that lets us mount up on wings like eagles; lets us run 
		and not be weary; lets us walk and not faint. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let us hold fast to that 
		faith, as Joshua held fast to the faith of his fathers, and together, we 
		shall overcome the challenges of a new age.&nbsp;Together, we shall seize the 
		promise of this moment.&nbsp; Together, we shall make a way through winter, 
		and we're going to welcome the spring.&nbsp; Through God all things are 
		possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">May the memory of Dr. Martin 
		Luther King continue to inspire us and ennoble our world and all who 
		inhabit it.&nbsp; And may God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you 
		very much, everybody.&nbsp; God bless you.</font></p>
