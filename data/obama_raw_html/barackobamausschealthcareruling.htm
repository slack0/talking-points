<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#CE0A04" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good afternoon.&nbsp; Earlier 
		today, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable 
		Care Act -- the name of the health care reform we passed two years ago.&nbsp; 
		In doing so, they've reaffirmed a fundamental principle that here in 
		America -- in the wealthiest nation on Earth – no illness or accident 
		should lead to any family’s financial ruin.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know there will be a lot 
		of discussion today about the politics of all this, about who won and 
		who lost.&nbsp; That’s how these things tend to be viewed here in 
		Washington.&nbsp; But that discussion completely misses the point.&nbsp; Whatever 
		the politics, today’s decision was a victory for people all over this 
		country whose lives will be more secure because of this law and the 
		Supreme Court’s decision to uphold it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And because this law has a 
		direct impact on so many Americans, I want to take this opportunity to 
		talk about exactly what it means for you.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, if you’re one of the 
		more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you 
		will keep your health insurance -- this law will only make it more 
		secure and more affordable.&nbsp; Insurance companies can no longer impose 
		lifetime limits on the amount of care you receive.&nbsp; They can no longer 
		discriminate against children with preexisting conditions.&nbsp; They can no 
		longer drop your coverage if you get sick.&nbsp; They can no longer jack up 
		your premiums without reason.&nbsp; They are required to provide free 
		preventive care like check-ups and mammograms -- a provision that's 
		already helped 54 million Americans with private insurance.&nbsp; And by this 
		August, nearly 13 million of you will receive a rebate from your 
		insurance company because it spent too much on things like 
		administrative costs and CEO bonuses, and not enough on your health 
		care.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There’s more.&nbsp; Because of 
		the Affordable Care Act, young adults under the age of 26 are able to 
		stay on their parent's health care plans -- a provision that's already 
		helped 6 million young Americans.&nbsp; And because of the Affordable Care 
		Act, seniors receive a discount on their prescription drugs -- a 
		discount that's already saved more than 5 million seniors on Medicare 
		about $600 each.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of this is happening 
		because of the Affordable Care Act. These provisions provide 
		common-sense protections for middle class families, and they enjoy broad 
		popular support.&nbsp; And thanks to today’s decision, all of these benefits 
		and protections will continue for Americans who already have health 
		insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, if you’re one of the 30 
		million Americans who don’t yet have health insurance, starting in 2014 
		this law will offer you an array of quality, affordable, private health 
		insurance plans to choose from.&nbsp; Each state will take the lead in 
		designing their own menu of options, and if states can come up with even 
		better ways of covering more people at the same quality and cost, this 
		law allows them to do that, too.&nbsp; And I’ve asked Congress to help speed 
		up that process, and give states this flexibility in year one.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once states set up these 
		health insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, insurance companies 
		will no longer be able to discriminate against any American with a 
		preexisting health condition.&nbsp; They won’t be able to charge you more 
		just because you’re a woman.&nbsp; They won’t be able to bill you into 
		bankruptcy. If you’re sick, you’ll finally have the same chance to get 
		quality, affordable health care as everyone else.&nbsp; And if you can’t 
		afford the premiums, you'll receive a credit that helps pay for it.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, the Supreme Court 
		also upheld the principle that people who can afford health insurance 
		should take the responsibility to buy health insurance.&nbsp; This is 
		important for two reasons.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, when uninsured people 
		who can afford coverage get sick, and show up at the emergency room for 
		care, the rest of us end up paying for their care in the form of higher 
		premiums.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And second, if you ask 
		insurance companies to cover people with preexisting conditions, but 
		don’t require people who can afford it to buy their own insurance, some 
		folks might wait until they’re sick to buy the care they need -- which 
		would also drive up everybody else’s premiums.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why, even though I 
		knew it wouldn’t be politically popular, and resisted the idea when I 
		ran for this office, we ultimately included a provision in the 
		Affordable Care Act that people who can afford to buy health insurance 
		should take the responsibility to do so.&nbsp; In fact, this idea has enjoyed 
		support from members of both parties, including the current Republican 
		nominee for President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Still, I know the debate 
		over this law has been divisive.&nbsp; I respect the very real concerns that 
		millions of Americans have shared.&nbsp; And I know a lot of coverage through 
		this health care debate has focused on what it means politically.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, it should be pretty 
		clear by now that I didn’t do this because it was good politics.&nbsp; I did 
		it because I believed it was good for the country.&nbsp; I did it because I 
		believed it was good for the American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There’s a framed letter that 
		hangs in my office right now.&nbsp; It was sent to me during the health care 
		debate by a woman named Natoma Canfield.&nbsp; For years and years, Natoma 
		did everything right.&nbsp; She bought health insurance.&nbsp; She paid her 
		premiums on time.&nbsp; But 18 years ago, Natoma was diagnosed with cancer.&nbsp; 
		And even though she’d been cancer-free for more than a decade, her 
		insurance company kept jacking up her rates, year after year.&nbsp; And 
		despite her desire to keep her coverage -- despite her fears that she 
		would get sick again -- she had to surrender her health insurance, and 
		was forced to hang her fortunes on chance.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I carried Natoma’s story 
		with me every day of the fight to pass this law.&nbsp; It reminded me of all 
		the Americans, all across the country, who have had to worry not only 
		about getting sick, but about the cost of getting well.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Natoma is well today.&nbsp; And 
		because of this law, there are other Americans -- other sons and 
		daughters, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers -- who will not 
		have to hang their fortunes on chance.&nbsp; These are the Americans for whom 
		we passed this law.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The highest Court in the 
		land has now spoken.&nbsp; We will continue to implement this law.&nbsp; And we'll 
		work together to improve on it where we can.&nbsp; But what we won’t do -- 
		what the country can’t afford to do -- is refight the political battles 
		of two years ago, or go back to the way things were.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With today’s announcement, 
		it’s time for us to move forward -- to implement and, where necessary, 
		improve on this law.&nbsp; And now is the time to keep our focus on the most 
		urgent challenge of our time:&nbsp; putting people back to work, paying down 
		our debt, and building an economy where people can have confidence that 
		if they work hard, they can get ahead.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But today, I’m as confident 
		as ever that when we look back five years from now, or 10 years from 
		now, or 20 years from now, we’ll be better off because we had the 
		courage to pass this law and keep moving forward.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp; God bless you, 
		and God bless America.</font></p>
