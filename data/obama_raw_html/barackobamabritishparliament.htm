transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, so much.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My Lord Chancellor, Mr. 
		Speaker, Mr. Prime Minister, my lords, and members of the House of 
		Commons:</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have known few greater 
		honors than the opportunity to address the Mother of Parliaments at 
		Westminster Hall.&nbsp;I am told that the last three speakers here have been 
		the Pope, Her Majesty the Queen, and Nelson Mandela -- which is either a 
		very high bar or the beginning of a very funny joke.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamabritishparliament1.jpg" width="269" height="190"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I come here today to 
		reaffirm one of the oldest, one of the strongest alliances the world has 
		ever known.&nbsp;It’s long been said that the United States and the United 
		Kingdom share a <i>
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relationship">
		<font color="#0000FF">special relationship</font></a></i>.&nbsp;And since we also share an 
		especially active press corps, that relationship is often analyzed and 
		overanalyzed for the slightest hint of stress or strain.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, all relationships 
		have their ups and downs.&nbsp;Admittedly, ours got off on the wrong foot 
		with a small scrape about tea and taxes.&nbsp;There may also have been some 
		hurt feelings when the White House was set on fire during the War of 
		1812.&nbsp;But fortunately, it’s been smooth sailing ever since.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The reason for this close 
		friendship doesn’t just have to do with our shared history, our shared 
		heritage; our ties of language and culture; or even the strong 
		partnership between our governments.&nbsp;Our relationship is special because 
		of the values and beliefs that have united our people through the ages.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Centuries ago, when kings, 
		emperors, and warlords reigned over much of the world, it was the 
		English who first spelled out the rights and liberties of man in the 
		Magna Carta.&nbsp;It was here, in this very hall, where the rule of law first 
		developed, courts were established, disputes were settled, and citizens 
		came to petition their leaders.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over time, the people of 
		this nation waged a long and sometimes bloody struggle to expand and 
		secure their freedom from the crown.&nbsp;Propelled by the ideals of the 
		Enlightenment, they would ultimately forge an English Bill of Rights, 
		and invest the power to govern in an elected parliament that’s gathered 
		here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What began on this island 
		would inspire millions throughout the continent of Europe and across the 
		world.&nbsp;But perhaps no one drew greater inspiration from these notions of 
		freedom than your rabble-rousing colonists on the other side of the 
		Atlantic.&nbsp;As Winston Churchill said, the</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">…Magna Carta, the 
			Bill of Rights, Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and English common law 
			find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of 
			Independence.</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For both of our nations, 
		living up to the ideals enshrined in these founding documents has 
		sometimes been difficult, has always been a work in progress.&nbsp;The path 
		has never been perfect. But through the struggles of slaves and 
		immigrants, women and ethnic minorities, former colonies and persecuted 
		religions, we have learned better than most that the longing for freedom 
		and human dignity is not English or American or Western -- it is 
		universal, and it beats in every heart.&nbsp;Perhaps that’s why there are few 
		nations that stand firmer, speak louder, and fight harder to defend 
		democratic values around the world than the United States and the United 
		Kingdom.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are the allies who landed 
		at Omaha and Gold, who sacrificed side by side to free a continent from 
		the march of tyranny, and help prosperity flourish from the ruins of 
		war.&nbsp;And with the founding of NATO -- a British idea -- we joined a 
		transatlantic alliance that has ensured our security for over half a 
		century.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Together with our allies, we 
		forged a lasting peace from a cold war.&nbsp;When the Iron Curtain lifted, we 
		expanded our alliance to include the nations of Central and Eastern 
		Europe, and built new bridges to Russia and the former states of the 
		Soviet Union. And when there was strife in the Balkans, we worked 
		together to keep the peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, after a difficult 
		decade that began with war and ended in recession, our nations have 
		arrived at a pivotal moment once more.&nbsp;A global economy that once stood 
		on the brink of depression is now stable and recovering.&nbsp;After years of 
		conflict, the United States has removed 100,000 troops from Iraq, the 
		United Kingdom has removed its forces, and our combat mission there has 
		ended.&nbsp;In Afghanistan, we’ve broken the Taliban’s momentum and will soon 
		begin a transition to Afghan lead.&nbsp;And nearly 10 years after 9/11, we 
		have disrupted terrorist networks and dealt al Qaeda a huge blow by 
		killing its leader -- Osama bin Laden.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Together, we have met great 
		challenges. But as we enter this new chapter in our shared history, 
		profound challenges stretch before us. In a world where the prosperity 
		of all nations is now inextricably linked, a new era of cooperation is 
		required to ensure the growth and stability of the global economy. As 
		new threats spread across borders and oceans, we must dismantle 
		terrorist networks and stop the spread of nuclear weapons, confront 
		climate change and combat famine and disease.&nbsp;And as a revolution races 
		through the streets of the Middle East and North Africa, the entire 
		world has a stake in the aspirations of a generation that longs to 
		determine its own destiny.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These challenges come at a 
		time when the international order has already been reshaped for a new 
		century.&nbsp;Countries like China, India, and Brazil are growing by leaps 
		and bounds.&nbsp;We should welcome this development, for it has lifted 
		hundreds of millions from poverty around the globe, and created new 
		markets and opportunities for our own nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, as this rapid 
		change has taken place, it’s become fashionable in some quarters to 
		question whether the rise of these nations will accompany the decline of 
		American and European influence around the world.&nbsp;Perhaps, the argument 
		goes, these nations represent the future, and the time for our 
		leadership has passed.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamabritishparliamentmain.jpg" width="474" height="247"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That argument is wrong.&nbsp;The 
		time for our leadership is now. It was the United States and the United 
		Kingdom and our democratic allies that shaped a world in which new 
		nations could emerge and individuals could thrive.&nbsp;And even as more 
		nations take on the responsibilities of global leadership, our alliance 
		will remain indispensable to the goal of a century that is more 
		peaceful, more prosperous and more just.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At a time when threats and 
		challenges require nations to work in concert with one another, we 
		remain the greatest catalysts for global action. In an era defined by 
		the rapid flow of commerce and information, it is our free market 
		tradition, our openness, fortified by our commitment to basic security 
		for our citizens, that offers the best chance of prosperity that is both 
		strong and shared.&nbsp;As millions are still denied their basic human rights 
		because of who they are, or what they believe, or the kind of government 
		that they live under, we are the nations most willing to stand up for 
		the values of tolerance and self-determination that lead to peace and 
		dignity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this doesn’t mean we 
		can afford to stand still.&nbsp;The nature of our leadership will need to 
		change with the times.&nbsp;As I said the first time I came to London as 
		President, for the G20 summit, the days are gone when Roosevelt and 
		Churchill could sit in a room and solve the world’s problems over a 
		glass of brandy&nbsp;-- although I’m sure that Prime Minister Cameron would 
		agree that some days we could both use a stiff drink.&nbsp;In this century, 
		our joint leadership will require building new partnerships, adapting to 
		new circumstances, and remaking ourselves to meet the demands of a new 
		era.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That begins with our 
		economic leadership.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Adam Smith’s central insight 
		remains true today:&nbsp;There is no greater generator of wealth and 
		innovation than a system of free enterprise that unleashes the full 
		potential of individual men and women.&nbsp;That’s what led to the Industrial 
		Revolution that began in the factories of Manchester.&nbsp;That is what led 
		to the dawn of the Information Age that arose from the office parks of 
		Silicon Valley.&nbsp;That’s why countries like China, India and Brazil are 
		growing so rapidly -- because in fits and starts, they are moving toward 
		market-based principles that the United States and the United Kingdom 
		have always embraced.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In other words, we live in a 
		global economy that is largely of our own making.&nbsp;And today, the 
		competition for the best jobs and industries favors countries that are 
		free-thinking and forward-looking; countries with the most creative and 
		innovative and entrepreneurial citizens.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That gives nations like the 
		United States and the United Kingdom an inherent advantage. For from 
		Newton and Darwin to Edison and Einstein, from Alan Turing to Steve 
		Jobs, we have led the world in our commitment to science and 
		cutting-edge research, the discovery of new medicines and 
		technologies.&nbsp;We educate our citizens and train our workers in the best 
		colleges and universities on Earth.&nbsp;But to maintain this advantage in a 
		world that’s more competitive than ever, we will have to redouble our 
		investments in science and engineering, and renew our national 
		commitments to educating our workforces.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ve also been reminded in 
		the last few years that markets can sometimes fail. In the last century, 
		both our nations put in place regulatory frameworks to deal with such 
		market failures -- safeguards to protect the banking system after the 
		Great Depression, for example; regulations that were established to 
		prevent the pollution of our air and water during the 1970s.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But in today’s economy, such 
		threats of market failure can no longer be contained within the borders 
		of any one country. Market failures can go global, and go viral, and 
		demand international responses.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A financial crisis that 
		began on Wall Street infected nearly every continent, which is why we 
		must keep working through forums like the G20 to put in place global 
		rules of the road to prevent future excesses and abuse.&nbsp;No country can 
		hide from the dangers of carbon pollution, which is why we must build on 
		what was achieved at Copenhagen and Cancun to leave our children a 
		planet that is safer and cleaner.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, even when the free 
		market works as it should, both our countries recognize that no matter 
		how responsibly we live in our lives, hard times or bad luck, a 
		crippling illness or a layoff may strike any one of us.&nbsp;And so part of 
		our common tradition has expressed itself in a conviction that every 
		citizen deserves a basic measure of security -- health care if you get 
		sick, unemployment insurance if you lose your job, a dignified 
		retirement after a lifetime of hard work.&nbsp;That commitment to our 
		citizens has also been the reason for our leadership in the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And now, having come through 
		a terrible recession, our challenge is to meet these obligations while 
		ensuring that we’re not consuming -- and hence consumed with -- a level 
		of debt that could sap the strength and vitality of our economies. And 
		that will require difficult choices and it will require different paths 
		for both of our countries.&nbsp;But we have faced such challenges before, and 
		have always been able to balance the need for fiscal responsibility with 
		the responsibilities we have to one another.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I believe we can do this 
		again.&nbsp;As we do, the successes and failures of our own past can serve as 
		an example for emerging economies -- that it’s possible to grow without 
		polluting; that lasting prosperity comes not from what a nation 
		consumes, but from what it produces, and from the investments it makes 
		in its people and its infrastructure.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And just as we must lead on 
		behalf of the prosperity of our citizens, so we must safeguard their 
		security.&nbsp;Our two nations know what it is to confront evil in the 
		world.&nbsp; Hitler’s armies would not have stopped their killing had we not 
		fought them on the beaches and on the landing grounds, in the fields and 
		on the streets.&nbsp;We must never forget that there was nothing inevitable 
		about our victory in that terrible war.&nbsp;It was won through the courage 
		and character of our people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Precisely because we are 
		willing to bear its burden, we know well the cost of war.&nbsp; And that is 
		why we built an alliance that was strong enough to defend this continent 
		while deterring our enemies. At its core, NATO is rooted in the simple 
		concept of Article Five:&nbsp;that no NATO nation will have to fend on its 
		own; that allies will stand by one another, always. And for six decades, 
		NATO has been the most successful alliance in human history.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, we confront a 
		different enemy. Terrorists have taken the lives of our citizens in New 
		York and in London. And while al Qaeda seeks a religious war with the 
		West, we must remember that they have killed thousands of Muslims -- 
		men, women and children -- around the globe. Our nations are not and 
		will never be at war with Islam.&nbsp; Our fight is focused on defeating al 
		Qaeda and its extremist allies.&nbsp;In that effort, we will not relent, as 
		Osama bin Laden and his followers have learned.&nbsp;And as we fight an enemy 
		that respects no law of war, we will continue to hold ourselves to a 
		higher standard -- by living up to the values, the rule of law and due 
		process that we so ardently defend.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For almost a decade, 
		Afghanistan has been a central front of these efforts.&nbsp; Throughout those 
		years, you, the British people, have been a stalwart ally, along with so 
		many others who fight by our side.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="0" src="../../images/barackobamabritishparliamentmain3.jpg" width="476" height="294" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Together, let us pay tribute 
		to all of our men and women who have served and sacrificed over the last 
		several years -- for they are part of an unbroken line of heroes who 
		have borne the heaviest burden for the freedoms that we enjoy.&nbsp;Because 
		of them, we have broken the Taliban’s momentum.&nbsp;Because of them, we have 
		built the capacity of Afghan security forces.&nbsp;And because of them, we 
		are now preparing to turn a corner in Afghanistan by transitioning to 
		Afghan lead.&nbsp;And during this transition, we will pursue a lasting peace 
		with those who break free of al Qaeda and respect the Afghan 
		constitution and lay down arms.&nbsp;And we will ensure that Afghanistan is 
		never a safe haven for terror, but is instead a country that is strong, 
		sovereign, and able to stand on its own two feet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Indeed, our efforts in this 
		young century have led us to a new concept for NATO that will give us 
		the capabilities needed to meet new threats -- threats like terrorism 
		and piracy, cyber attacks and ballistic missiles.&nbsp;But a revitalized NATO 
		will continue to hew to that original vision of its founders, allowing 
		us to rally collective action for the defense of our people, while 
		building upon the broader belief of Roosevelt and Churchill that all 
		nations have both rights and responsibilities, and all nations share a 
		common interest in an international architecture that maintains the 
		peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also share a common 
		interest in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.&nbsp;Across the globe, 
		nations are locking down nuclear materials so they never fall into the 
		wrong hands -- because of our leadership.&nbsp;From North Korea to Iran, 
		we’ve sent a message that those who flaunt their obligations will face 
		consequences -- which is why America and the European Union just 
		recently strengthened our sanctions on Iran, in large part because of 
		the leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States.&nbsp;And while we 
		hold others to account, we will meet our own obligations under the 
		Non-Proliferation Treaty, and strive for a world without nuclear 
		weapons.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We share a common interest 
		in resolving conflicts that prolong human suffering and threaten to tear 
		whole regions asunder.&nbsp;In Sudan, after years of war and thousands of 
		deaths, we call on both North and South to pull back from the brink of 
		violence and choose the path of peace.&nbsp;And in the Middle East, we stand 
		united in our support for a secure Israel and a sovereign Palestine.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we share a common 
		interest in development that advances dignity and security.&nbsp;To succeed, 
		we must cast aside the impulse to look at impoverished parts of the 
		globe as a place for charity.&nbsp;Instead, we should empower the same forces 
		that have allowed our own people to thrive:&nbsp;We should help the hungry to 
		feed themselves, the doctors who care for the sick.&nbsp;We should support 
		countries that confront corruption, and allow their people to 
		innovate.&nbsp;And we should advance the truth that nations prosper when they 
		allow women and girls to reach their full potential.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We do these things because 
		we believe not simply in the rights of nations; we believe in the rights 
		of citizens.&nbsp;That is the beacon that guided us through our fight against 
		fascism and our twilight struggle against communism.&nbsp;And today, that 
		idea is being put to the test in the Middle East and North Africa.&nbsp;In 
		country after country, people are mobilizing to free themselves from the 
		grip of an iron fist.&nbsp;And while these movements for change are just six 
		months old, we have seen them play out before -- from Eastern Europe to 
		the Americas, from South Africa to Southeast Asia.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">History tells us that 
		democracy is not easy.&nbsp;It will be years before these revolutions reach 
		their conclusion, and there will be difficult days along the way. Power 
		rarely gives up without a fight -- particularly in places where there 
		are divisions of tribe and divisions of sect.&nbsp;We also know that populism 
		can take dangerous turns -- from the extremism of those who would use 
		democracy to deny minority rights, to the nationalism that left so many 
		scars on this continent in the 20th century.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But make no mistake:&nbsp;What we 
		saw, what we are seeing in Tehran, in Tunis, in Tahrir Square, is a 
		longing for the same freedoms that we take for granted here at home.&nbsp;It 
		was a rejection of the notion that people in certain parts of the world 
		don’t want to be free, or need to have democracy imposed upon them.&nbsp;It 
		was a rebuke to the worldview of al Qaeda, which smothers the rights of 
		individuals, and would thereby subject them to perpetual poverty and 
		violence.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let there be no doubt:&nbsp;The 
		United States and United Kingdom stand squarely on the side of those who 
		long to be free.&nbsp;And now, we must show that we will back up those words 
		with deeds.&nbsp;That means investing in the future of those nations that 
		transition to democracy, starting with Tunisia and Egypt -- by deepening 
		ties of trade and commerce; by helping them demonstrate that freedom 
		brings prosperity.&nbsp;And that means standing up for universal rights -- by 
		sanctioning those who pursue repression, strengthening civil society, 
		supporting the rights of minorities.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We do this knowing that the 
		West must overcome suspicion and mistrust among many in the Middle East 
		and North Africa -- a mistrust that is rooted in a difficult past.&nbsp;For 
		years, we’ve faced charges of hypocrisy from those who do not enjoy the 
		freedoms that they hear us espouse.&nbsp;And so to them, we must squarely 
		acknowledge that, yes, we have enduring interests in the region -- to 
		fight terror, sometimes with partners who may not be perfect; to protect 
		against disruptions of the world’s energy supply.&nbsp;But we must also 
		insist that we reject as false the choice between our interests and our 
		ideals; between stability and democracy.&nbsp;For our idealism is rooted in 
		the realities of history -- that repression offers only the false 
		promise of stability, that societies are more successful when their 
		citizens are free, and that democracies are the closest allies we have.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is that truth that guides 
		our action in Libya.&nbsp;It would have been easy at the outset of the 
		crackdown in Libya to say that none of this was our business -- that a 
		nation’s sovereignty is more important than the slaughter of civilians 
		within its borders. That argument carries weight with some.&nbsp;But we are 
		different.&nbsp;We embrace a broader responsibility.&nbsp;And while we cannot stop 
		every injustice, there are circumstances that cut through our caution -- 
		when a leader is threatening to massacre his people, and the 
		international community is calling for action.&nbsp;That’s why we stopped a 
		massacre in Libya.&nbsp; And we will not relent until the people of Libya are 
		protected and the shadow of tyranny is lifted.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will proceed with 
		humility, and the knowledge that we cannot dictate every outcome 
		abroad.&nbsp;Ultimately, freedom must be won by the people themselves, not 
		imposed from without. But we can and must stand with those who so 
		struggle.&nbsp; Because we have always believed that the future of our 
		children and grandchildren will be better if other people’s children and 
		grandchildren are more prosperous and more free -- from the beaches of 
		Normandy to the Balkans to Benghazi.&nbsp;That is our interests and our 
		ideals.&nbsp;And if we fail to meet that responsibility, who would take our 
		place, and what kind of world would we pass on?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our action -- our leadership 
		-- is essential to the cause of human dignity.&nbsp;And so we must act -- and 
		lead -- with confidence in our ideals, and an abiding faith in the 
		character of our people, who sent us all here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For there is one final 
		quality that I believe makes the United States and the United Kingdom 
		indispensable to this moment in history.&nbsp;And that is how we define 
		ourselves as nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unlike most countries in the 
		world, we do not define citizenship based on race or ethnicity.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamabritishparliament5.jpg" width="318" height="203">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">Being 
		American or British is not about belonging to a certain group; it’s 
		about believing in a certain set of ideals -- the rights of individuals, 
		the rule of law.&nbsp;That is why we hold incredible diversity within our 
		borders.&nbsp;That’s why there are people around the world right now who 
		believe that if they come to America, if they come to New York, if they 
		come to London, if they work hard, they can pledge allegiance to our 
		flag and call themselves Americans; if they come to England, they can 
		make a new life for themselves and can sing God Save The Queen just like 
		any other citizen.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, our diversity can lead 
		to tension.&nbsp;And throughout our history there have been heated debates 
		about immigration and assimilation in both of our countries.&nbsp;But even as 
		these debates can be difficult, we fundamentally recognize that our 
		patchwork heritage is an enormous strength -- that in a world which will 
		only grow smaller and more interconnected, the example of our two 
		nations says it is possible for people to be united by their ideals, 
		instead of divided by their differences; that it’s possible for hearts 
		to change and old hatreds to pass; that it’s possible for the sons and 
		daughters of former colonies to sit here as members of this great 
		Parliament, and for the grandson of a Kenyan who served as a cook in the 
		British Army to stand before you as President of the United States.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is what defines 
		us.&nbsp;That is why the young men and women in the streets of Damascus and 
		Cairo still reach for the rights our citizens enjoy, even if they 
		sometimes differ with our policies.&nbsp;As two of the most powerful nations 
		in the history of the world, we must always remember that the true 
		source of our influence hasn’t just been the size of our economies, or 
		the reach of our militaries, or the land that we’ve claimed.&nbsp;It has been 
		the values that we must never waver in defending around the world -- the 
		idea that all beings are endowed by our Creator with certain rights that 
		cannot be denied.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is what forged our bond 
		in the fire of war -- a bond made manifest by the friendship between two 
		of our greatest leaders.&nbsp;Churchill and Roosevelt had their 
		differences.&nbsp;They were keen observers of each other’s blind spots and 
		shortcomings, if not always their own, and they were hard-headed about 
		their ability to remake the world. But what joined the fates of these 
		two men at that particular moment in history was not simply a shared 
		interest in victory on the battlefield.&nbsp;It was a shared belief in the 
		ultimate triumph of human freedom and human dignity -- a conviction that 
		we have a say in how this story ends.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This conviction lives on in 
		their people today.&nbsp;The challenges we face are great.&nbsp;The work before us 
		is hard.&nbsp;But we have come through a difficult decade, and whenever the 
		tests and trials ahead may seem too big or too many, let us turn to 
		their example, and the words that Churchill spoke on the day that Europe 
		was freed:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the long years to 
			come, not only will the people of this island but…the world, 
			wherever the bird of freedom chirps in [the] human heart, look back 
			to what we’ve done, and they will say ‘do not despair, do not 
			yield…march straightforward’.</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>

		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamabritishparliamentmain6.png" width="476" height="224"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With courage and purpose, 
		with humility and with hope, with faith in the promise of tomorrow, let 
		us march straightforward together, enduring allies in the cause of a 
		world that is more peaceful, more prosperous, and more just.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.</font></p>
