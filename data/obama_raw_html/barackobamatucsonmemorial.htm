transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp;Please&nbsp; -- 
		Please be seated.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To the families of those 
		we’ve lost; to all who called them friends; to the students of this 
		university, the public servants who are gathered here, the people of 
		Tucson and the people of Arizona: I have come here tonight as an 
		American who, like all Americans, kneels to pray with you today and will 
		stand by you tomorrow.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is nothing I can say 
		that will fill the sudden hole torn in your hearts.&nbsp; But know this:&nbsp;The 
		hopes of a nation are here tonight.&nbsp; We mourn with you for the fallen.&nbsp; 
		We join you in your grief.&nbsp; And we add our faith to yours that 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Giffords">
		<font color="#0000FF">Representative Gabrielle Giffords</font></a> and the other living victims of this 
		tragedy will pull through.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Scripture tells us:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a river whose 
		streams make glad the city of God,<br>the holy place where the Most High dwells.<br>God is within her, she will not fall;<br>God will help her at break of day.</font><font face="Verdana"><b><sup><font color="#FF0000" size="1">1</font></sup></b></font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Saturday morning, 
		Gabby, her staff and many of her constituents gathered outside a 
		supermarket to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and free 
		speech.&nbsp;They were fulfilling a central tenet of the democracy envisioned 
		by our founders –- representatives of the people answering questions to 
		their constituents, so as to carry their concerns back to our nation’s 
		capital.&nbsp; Gabby called it “Congress on Your Corner” -– just an updated 
		version of government of and by and for the people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that quintessentially 
		American scene, that was the scene that was shattered by a gunman’s 
		bullets.&nbsp; And the six people who lost their lives on Saturday –- they, 
		too, represented what is best in us, what is best in America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roll"><font color="#0000FF">Judge John Roll</font></a> served our 
		legal system for nearly 40 years. A graduate of this university and a 
		graduate of this law school -- Judge Roll was recommended for the 
		federal bench by John McCain 20 years ago -- appointed by President 
		George H.W. Bush and rose to become Arizona’s chief federal judge.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">His colleagues described 
		him as the hardest-working judge within the Ninth Circuit.&nbsp; He was on 
		his way back from attending Mass, as he did every day, when he decided 
		to stop by and say hi to his representative.&nbsp; John is survived by his 
		loving wife, Maureen, his three sons and his five beautiful 
		grandchildren.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">George and Dorothy Morris 
		-– “Dot” to her friends -– were high school sweethearts who got married 
		and had two daughters.&nbsp; They did everything together -- traveling the 
		open road in their RV, enjoying what their friends called a 50-year 
		honeymoon.&nbsp; Saturday morning, they went by the Safeway to hear what 
		their congresswoman had to say.&nbsp; When gunfire rang out, George, a former 
		Marine, instinctively tried to shield his wife.&nbsp; Both were shot.&nbsp; Dot 
		passed away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A New Jersey native, 
		Phyllis Schneck retired to Tucson to beat the snow.&nbsp; But in the summer, 
		she would return East, where her world revolved around her three 
		children, her seven grandchildren and 2-year-old great-granddaughter.&nbsp; A 
		gifted quilter, she’d often work under a favorite tree, or sometimes 
		she'd sew aprons with the logos of the Jets and the Giants -- to give 
		out at the church where she volunteered.&nbsp; A Republican, she took a 
		liking to Gabby, and wanted to get to know her better.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard 
		grew up in Tucson together -– about 70 years ago.&nbsp; They moved apart and 
		started their own respective families.&nbsp; But after both were widowed they 
		found their way back here, to, as one of Mavy’s daughters put it, “be 
		boyfriend and girlfriend again.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When they weren’t out on 
		the road in their motor home, you could find them just up the road, 
		helping folks in need at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ.&nbsp; A 
		retired construction worker, Dorwan spent his spare time fixing up the 
		church along with his dog, Tux.&nbsp; His final act of selflessness was to 
		dive on top of his wife, sacrificing his life for hers.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Everything -- everything 
		-- Gabe Zimmerman did, he did with passion.&nbsp; But his true passion was 
		helping people.&nbsp; As Gabby’s outreach director, he made the cares of 
		thousands of her constituents his own, seeing to it that seniors got the 
		Medicare benefits that they had earned, that veterans got the medals and 
		the care that they deserved, that government was working for ordinary 
		folks.&nbsp; He died doing what he loved -– talking with people and seeing 
		how he could help.&nbsp; And Gabe is survived by his parents, Ross and Emily, 
		his brother, Ben, and his fiancée, Kelly, who he planned to marry next 
		year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then there is 
		nine-year-old Christina Taylor Green.&nbsp; Christina was an A student; she 
		was a dancer; she was a gymnast; she was a swimmer.&nbsp; She decided that 
		she wanted to be the first woman to play in the Major Leagues, and as 
		the only girl on her Little League team, no one put it past her.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">She showed an appreciation 
		for life uncommon for a girl her age.&nbsp; She’d remind her mother, “We are 
		so blessed.&nbsp; We have the best life.”&nbsp; And she’d pay those blessings back 
		by participating in a charity that helped children who were less 
		fortunate.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our hearts are broken by 
		their sudden passing.&nbsp; Our hearts are broken -– and yet, our hearts also 
		have reason for fullness. Our hearts are full of hope and thanks for the 
		13 Americans who survived the shooting, including the congresswoman many 
		of them went to see on Saturday.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have just come from the 
		University Medical Center, just a mile from here, where our friend Gabby 
		courageously fights to recover even as we speak.&nbsp; And I want to tell you 
		-- her husband Mark is here and he allows me to share this with you -- 
		right after we went to visit, a few minutes after we left her room and 
		some of her colleagues in Congress were in the room, Gabby opened her 
		eyes for the first time.&nbsp;Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gabby opened her eyes.&nbsp; 
		Gabby opened her eyes, so I can tell you she knows we are here.&nbsp; She 
		knows we love her.&nbsp; And she knows that we are rooting for her through 
		what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey.&nbsp; We are there for 
		her.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our hearts are full of 
		thanks for that good news, and our hearts are full of gratitude for 
		those who saved others.&nbsp; We are grateful to Daniel Hernandez -- a 
		volunteer in Gabby’s office.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, Daniel, I’m sorry, 
		you may deny it, but we’ve decided you are a hero because -- you ran 
		through the chaos to minister to your boss, and tended to her wounds and 
		helped keep her alive.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamatucsonmemorialdanielhernandez.jpg" width="299" height="277"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are grateful to the men 
		who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload.&nbsp; Right over there.&nbsp; We 
		are grateful for petite Patricia Maisch, who wrestled away the killer’s 
		ammunition, and undoubtedly saved some lives.&nbsp;And we are grateful for 
		the doctors and nurses and first responders who worked wonders to heal 
		those who’d been hurt.&nbsp; We are grateful to them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These men and women remind 
		us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle.&nbsp; They remind 
		us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength.&nbsp; 
		Heroism is here, in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens, all 
		around us, just waiting to be summoned -– as it was on Saturday morning. 
		Their actions, their selflessness poses a challenge to each of us.&nbsp; It 
		raises a question of what, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is 
		required of us going forward.&nbsp; How can we honor the fallen?&nbsp; How can we 
		be true to their memory?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You see, when a tragedy 
		like this strikes, it is part of our nature to demand explanations –- to 
		try and pose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which 
		seems senseless.&nbsp; Already we’ve seen a national conversation commence, 
		not only about the motivations behind these killings, but about 
		everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our 
		mental health system.&nbsp; And much of this process, of debating what might 
		be done to prevent such tragedies in the future, is an essential 
		ingredient in our exercise of self-government.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But at a time when our 
		discourse has become so sharply polarized -– at a time when we are far 
		too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of 
		those who happen to think differently than we do -– it’s important for 
		us to pause for a moment and make sure that we’re talking with each 
		other in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Scripture tells us that 
		there is evil in the world, and that terrible things happen for reasons 
		that defy human understanding. In the words of Job, “When I looked for 
		light, then came darkness.”&nbsp; Bad things happen, and we have to guard 
		against simple explanations in the aftermath.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For the truth is none of 
		us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack.&nbsp; None of us can 
		know with any certainty what might have stopped these shots from being 
		fired, or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man’s 
		mind.&nbsp; Yes, we have to examine all the facts behind this tragedy.&nbsp; We 
		cannot and will not be passive in the face of such violence.&nbsp; We should 
		be willing to challenge old assumptions in order to lessen the prospects 
		of such violence in the future.&nbsp;But what we cannot do is use this 
		tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other.&nbsp;That we cannot do.&nbsp; 
		That we cannot do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we discuss these 
		issues, let each of us do so with a good dose of humility.&nbsp; Rather than 
		pointing fingers or assigning blame, let’s use this occasion to expand 
		our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to 
		sharpen our instincts for empathy and remind ourselves of all the ways 
		that our hopes and dreams are bound together.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">After all, that’s what 
		most of us do when we lose somebody in our family -– especially if the 
		loss is unexpected.&nbsp; We’re shaken out of our routines.&nbsp; We’re forced to 
		look inward.&nbsp; We reflect on the past:&nbsp; Did we spend enough time with an 
		aging parent, we wonder.&nbsp; Did we express our gratitude for all the 
		sacrifices that they made for us?&nbsp; Did we tell a spouse just how 
		desperately we loved them, not just once in a while but every single 
		day?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So sudden loss causes us 
		to look backward -– but it also forces us to look forward; to reflect on 
		the present and the future, on the manner in which we live our lives and 
		nurture our relationships with those who are still with us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We may ask ourselves if 
		we’ve shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people 
		in our lives.&nbsp; Perhaps we question whether we're doing right by our 
		children, or our community, whether our priorities are in order.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We recognize our own 
		mortality, and we are reminded that in the fleeting time we have on this 
		Earth, what matters is not wealth, or status, or power, or fame -– but 
		rather, how well we have loved -- and what small part we have played in 
		making the lives of other people better.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that process -- that 
		process of reflection, of making sure we align our values with our 
		actions –- that, I believe, is what a tragedy like this requires.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For those who were harmed, 
		those who were killed –- they are part of our family, an American family 
		300 million strong. We may not have known them personally, but surely we 
		see ourselves in them.&nbsp; In George and Dot, in Dorwan and Mavy, we sense 
		the abiding love we have for our own husbands, our own wives, our own 
		life partners.&nbsp; Phyllis –- she’s our mom or our grandma; Gabe our 
		brother or son.&nbsp;In Judge Roll, we recognize not only a man who prized 
		his family and doing his job well, but also a man who embodied America’s 
		fidelity to the law.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And in Gabby -- in Gabby, 
		we see a reflection of our public-spiritedness; that desire to 
		participate in that sometimes frustrating, sometimes contentious, but 
		always necessary and never-ending process to form a more perfect union.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And in Christina -- in 
		Christina we see all of our children. So curious, so trusting, so 
		energetic, so full of magic.&nbsp; So deserving of our love.&nbsp; And so 
		deserving of our good example.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If this tragedy prompts 
		reflection and debate -- as it should -- let’s make sure it’s worthy of 
		those we have lost.&nbsp;Let’s make sure it’s not on the usual plane of 
		politics and point-scoring and pettiness that drifts away in the next 
		news cycle.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The loss of these 
		wonderful people should make every one of us strive to be better.&nbsp; To be 
		better in our private lives, to be better friends and neighbors and 
		coworkers and parents.&nbsp; And if, as has been discussed in recent days, 
		their death helps usher in more civility in our public discourse, let us 
		remember it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy 
		-- it did not -- but rather because only a more civil and honest public 
		discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation in a way 
		that would make them proud.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We should be civil because 
		we want to live up to the example of public servants like John Roll and 
		Gabby Giffords, who knew first and foremost that we are all Americans, 
		and that we can question each other’s ideas without questioning each 
		other’s love of country and that our task, working together, is to 
		constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the 
		American Dream to future generations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They believed -- they 
		believed, and I believe that we can be better.&nbsp; Those who died here, 
		those who saved life here –- they help me believe.&nbsp; We may not be able 
		to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another, 
		that’s entirely up to us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I believe that for all 
		our imperfections, we are full of decency and goodness, and that the 
		forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us.&nbsp; </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s what I believe, in 
		part because that’s what a child like Christina Taylor Green believed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Imagine -- imagine for a 
		moment, here was a young girl who was just becoming aware of our 
		democracy; just beginning to understand the obligations of citizenship; 
		just starting to glimpse the fact that some day she, too, might play a 
		part in shaping her nation’s future.&nbsp; She had been elected to her 
		student council.&nbsp; She saw public service as something exciting and 
		hopeful.&nbsp; She was off to meet her congresswoman, someone she was sure 
		was good and important and might be a role model.&nbsp; She saw all this 
		through the eyes of a child, undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we 
		adults all too often just take for granted.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to live up to her 
		expectations.&nbsp;I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined 
		it.&nbsp; I want America to be as good as she imagined it.&nbsp; All of us -– we 
		should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our 
		children’s expectations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As has already been 
		mentioned, Christina was given to us on September 11th, 2001, one of 50 
		babies born that day to be pictured in a book called “Faces of Hope.”&nbsp; 
		On either side of her photo in that book were simple wishes for a 
		child’s life.&nbsp; “I hope you help those in need,” read one.&nbsp; “I hope you 
		know all the words to the National Anthem and sing it with your hand 
		over your heart.&quot; &quot;I hope&quot; -- &quot;I hope you jump in rain puddles.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If there are rain puddles 
		in Heaven, Christina is jumping in them today.&nbsp; And here on this Earth 
		-- here on this Earth, we place our hands over our hearts, and we commit 
		ourselves as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of 
		her gentle, happy spirit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">May God bless and keep 
		those we’ve lost in restful and eternal peace.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">May He love and watch 
		over the survivors.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And may He bless the United States of America.</font></p>
