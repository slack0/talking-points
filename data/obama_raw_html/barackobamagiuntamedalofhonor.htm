&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; 
		Please be seated.&nbsp; On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the 
		White House.&nbsp; Thank you, Chaplain Carver, for that beautiful invocation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of all the privileges that 
		come with serving as President of the United States, I have none greater 
		than serving as Commander-in-Chief of the finest military that the world 
		has ever known.&nbsp; And of all the military decorations that a President 
		and a nation can bestow, there is none higher than the Medal of Honor.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today is particularly 
		special.&nbsp; Since the end of the Vietnam War, the Medal of Honor has been 
		awarded nine times for conspicuous gallantry in an ongoing or recent 
		conflict.&nbsp; Sadly, our nation has been unable to present this decoration 
		to the recipients themselves, because each gave his life -- his last 
		full measure of devotion -- for our country.&nbsp; Indeed, as President, I 
		have presented the Medal of Honor three times -- and each time to the 
		families of a fallen hero.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, therefore, marks the 
		first time in nearly 40 years that the recipient of the Medal of Honor 
		for an ongoing conflict has been able to come to the White House and 
		accept this recognition in person.&nbsp; It is my privilege to present our 
		nation’s highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, to a soldier 
		as humble as he is heroic: Staff Sergeant Salvatore A. Giunta.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I’m going to go 
		off-script here for a second and just say I really like this guy.&nbsp; 
		I think anybody -- we all just get a sense of 
		people and who they are, and when you meet Sal and you meet his family, 
		you are just absolutely convinced that this is what America is all 
		about.&nbsp; And it just makes you proud.&nbsp; And so this is a joyous occasion 
		for me -- something that I have been looking forward to.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Medal of Honor reflects 
		the gratitude of an entire nation.&nbsp; So we are also joined here today by 
		several members of Congress, including both senators and several 
		representatives from Staff Sergeant Giunta’s home state of Iowa.&nbsp; We are 
		also joined by leaders from across my administration and the Department 
		of Defense, including the Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates; Chairman 
		of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen.&nbsp; Where’s Mike?&nbsp; There 
		he is, right there.&nbsp; Army Secretary John McHugh; and Chief of Staff of 
		the Army, General George Casey.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are especially honored to 
		be joined by Staff Sergeant Giunta’s fellow soldiers, his teammates and 
		brothers from Battle Company, 2d of the 503d of the 173d Airborne 
		Brigade; and several members of that rarest of fraternities that now 
		welcomes him into its ranks -- the Medal of Honor Society.&nbsp; Please give 
		them a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also welcome the friends 
		and family who made Staff Sergeant Giunta into the man that he is, 
		including his lovely wife, Jenny; and his parents, Steven and Rosemary; 
		as well as his siblings, who are here.&nbsp; It was his mother, after all, 
		who apparently taught him as a young boy in small-town Iowa how to 
		remove the screen from his bedroom window in case of fire.&nbsp; What she didn’t know was that by teaching Sal how to jump from his 
		bedroom and sneaking off in the dead of night, she was unleashing a 
		future paratrooper -- who would one day fight in the 
		rugged mountains of Afghanistan 7,000 miles away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">During the first of his two 
		tours of duty in Afghanistan, Staff Sergeant Giunta was forced early on 
		to come to terms with the loss of comrades and friends.&nbsp; His team leader 
		at the time gave him a piece of advice:&nbsp; “You just try -- you just got 
		to try to do everything you can when it’s your time to do it.”&nbsp; You’ve 
		just got to try to do everything you can when it’s your time to do it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Salvatore Giunta’s time came 
		on October 25, 2007.&nbsp; He was a Specialist then, just 22 years old.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sal and his platoon were 
		several days into a mission in the Korengal Valley -- the most dangerous 
		valley in northeast Afghanistan.&nbsp; The moon was full.&nbsp; The light it cast 
		was enough to travel by without using their night-vision goggles.&nbsp; With 
		heavy gear on their backs, and air support overhead, they made their way 
		single file down a rocky ridge crest, along terrain so steep that 
		sliding was sometimes easier than walking.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They hadn’t traveled a 
		quarter mile before the silence was shattered.&nbsp; It was an ambush, so 
		close that the cracks of the guns and the whizz of the bullets were 
		simultaneous.&nbsp; Tracer fire hammered the ridge at hundreds of rounds per 
		minute -- “more,” Sal said later, “than the stars in the sky.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apache gunships above 
		saw it all, but couldn’t engage with the enemy so close to our 
		soldiers.&nbsp; The next platoon heard the shooting, but were too far away to 
		join the fight in time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the two lead men were 
		hit by enemy fire and knocked down instantly.&nbsp; When the third was struck 
		in the helmet and fell to the ground, Sal charged headlong into the wall 
		of bullets to pull him to safety behind what little cover there was.&nbsp; As 
		he did, Sal was hit twice -- one round slamming into his body armor, the 
		other shattering a weapon slung across his back.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They were pinned down, and 
		two wounded Americans still lay up ahead.&nbsp; So Sal and his comrades 
		regrouped and counterattacked.&nbsp; They threw grenades, using the 
		explosions as cover to run forward, shooting at the muzzle flashes still 
		erupting from the trees.&nbsp; Then they did it again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; Throwing 
		grenades, charging ahead.&nbsp; Finally, they reached one of their men.&nbsp; He’d 
		been shot twice in the leg, but he had kept returning fire until his gun 
		jammed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As another soldier tended to 
		his wounds, Sal sprinted ahead, at every step meeting relentless enemy 
		fire with his own.&nbsp; He crested a hill alone, with no cover but the dust 
		kicked up by the storm of bullets still biting into the ground.&nbsp; There, 
		he saw a chilling sight:&nbsp; the silhouettes of two insurgents carrying the 
		other wounded American away -- who happened to be one of Sal’s best 
		friends.&nbsp; Sal never broke stride.&nbsp; He leapt forward.&nbsp; He took aim.&nbsp; He 
		killed one of the insurgents and wounded the other, who ran off.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/salvatoregiunta.jpg" width="261" height="196">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">Sal found his friend alive, 
		but badly wounded.&nbsp; Sal had saved him from the enemy -- now he had to 
		try to save his life.&nbsp; Even as bullets impacted all around him, Sal 
		grabbed his friend by the vest and dragged him to cover.&nbsp; For nearly 
		half an hour, Sal worked to stop the bleeding and help his friend 
		breathe until the MEDEVAC arrived to lift the wounded from the ridge.&nbsp; 
		American gunships worked to clear the enemy from the hills.&nbsp; And with 
		the battle over, First Platoon picked up their gear and resumed their 
		march through the valley.&nbsp; They continued their mission.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It had been as intense and 
		violent a firefight as any soldier will experience.&nbsp; By the time it was 
		finished, every member of First Platoon had shrapnel or a bullet hole in 
		their gear.&nbsp; Five were wounded.&nbsp; And two gave their lives:&nbsp; Sal’s 
		friend, Sergeant Joshua C. Brennan, and the platoon medic, Specialist 
		Hugo V. Mendoza.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the parents of Joshua 
		and Hugo are here today.&nbsp; And I know that there are no words that, even 
		three years later, can ease the ache in your hearts or repay the debt 
		that America owes to you.&nbsp; But on behalf of a grateful nation, let me 
		express profound thanks to your sons’ service and their sacrifice.&nbsp; And 
		could the parents of Joshua and Hugo please stand briefly? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I already mentioned I 
		like this guy, Sal.&nbsp; And as I found out myself when I first spoke with 
		him on the phone and when we met in the Oval Office today, he is a 
		low-key guy, a humble guy, and he doesn’t seek the limelight.&nbsp; And he’ll 
		tell you that he didn’t do anything special; that he was just doing his 
		job; that any of his brothers in the unit would do the same thing.&nbsp; In 
		fact, he just lived up to what his team leader instructed him to do 
		years before:&nbsp; “You do everything you can.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Staff Sergeant Giunta, 
		repeatedly and without hesitation, you charged forward through extreme 
		enemy fire, embodying the warrior ethos that says, “I will never leave a 
		fallen comrade.”&nbsp; Your actions disrupted a devastating ambush before it 
		could claim more lives.&nbsp; Your courage prevented the capture of an 
		American soldier and brought that soldier back to his family.&nbsp; You may 
		believe that you don’t deserve this honor, but it was your fellow 
		soldiers who recommended you for it.&nbsp; In fact, your commander 
		specifically said in his recommendation that you lived up to the 
		standards of the most decorated American soldier of World War II, Audie 
		Murphy, who famously repelled an overwhelming enemy attack by himself 
		for one simple reason:&nbsp; “They were killing my friends.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why Salvatore Giunta 
		risked his life for his fellow soldiers -- because they would risk their 
		lives for him.&nbsp; That’s what fueled his bravery -- not just the urgent 
		impulse to have their backs, but the absolute confidence that they had 
		his.&nbsp; One of them, Sal has said -- of these young men that he was with, 
		he said, “They are just as much of me as I am.”&nbsp; They are just as much 
		of me as I am.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I would ask Sal’s team, 
		all of Battle Company who were with him that day, to please stand and be 
		recognized as well.&nbsp;Gentlemen, thank you for your 
		service.&nbsp; We’re all in your debt.&nbsp; And I’m proud to be your 
		Commander-in-Chief.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are the soldiers of 
		our Armed Forces.&nbsp; Highly trained.&nbsp; Battle-hardened.&nbsp; Each with 
		specialized roles and responsibilities, but all with one thing in common 
		-- they volunteered.&nbsp; In an era when it’s never been more tempting to 
		chase personal ambition or narrow self-interest, they chose the 
		opposite.&nbsp; They felt a tug; they answered a call; they said, “I’ll go.”&nbsp; 
		And for the better part of a decade, they have endured tour after tour 
		in distant and difficult places; they have protected us from danger; 
		they have given others the opportunity to earn a better and more secure 
		life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They are the courageous men 
		and women serving in Afghanistan even as we speak.&nbsp; They keep clear 
		focus on their mission:&nbsp; to deny safe haven for terrorists who would 
		attack our country, to break the back of the Taliban insurgency, to 
		build the Afghans’ capacity to defend themselves.&nbsp; They possess the 
		steely resolve to see their mission through.&nbsp; They are made of the same 
		strong stuff as the troops in this room, and I am absolutely confident 
		that they will continue to succeed in the missions that we give them, in 
		Afghanistan and beyond.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">After all, our brave 
		servicemen and women and their families have done everything they’ve 
		been asked to do.&nbsp; They have been everything that we have asked them to 
		be.&nbsp; “If I am a hero,” Sal has said, “then every man who stands around 
		me, every woman in the military, every person who defends this country 
		is.”&nbsp; And he’s right.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This medal today is a 
		testament to his uncommon valor, but also to the parents and the 
		community that raised him; the military that trained him; and all the 
		men and women who served by his side.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of them deserve our 
		enduring thanks and gratitude. They represent a small fraction of the 
		American population, but they and the families who await their safe 
		return carry far more than their fair share of our burden.&nbsp; They fight 
		halfway around the globe, but they do it in hopes that our children and 
		our grandchildren won’t have to.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They are the very best part 
		of us.&nbsp; They are our friends, our family, our neighbors, our classmates, 
		our coworkers.&nbsp; They are why our banner still waves, our founding 
		principles still shine, and our country -- the United States of America 
		-- still stands as a force for good all over the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, please join me in 
		welcoming Staff Sergeant Salvatore A. Giunta for the reading of the 
		citation.</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>MILITARY AIDE</u></b>:&nbsp; 
			<font color="#003300"><i>The 
		President of the United States of America, authorized by act of 
		Congress, March 3, 1863, has awarded, in the name of Congress, the Medal 
		of Honor to then Specialist Salvatore A. Giunta, United States Army.</i></font></font></p>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#003300">Specialist Salvatore A. 
		Giunta distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity, 
		at the risk of his life, above and beyond the call of duty, in action, 
		with an armed enemy in the Korengal Valley, Afghanistan, on October 25, 
		2007.</font></i></p>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#003300">While conducting a patrol as 
		team leader, with Company B, 2d Battalion Airborne, 503d Infantry 
		Regiment, Specialist Giunta and his team were navigating through harsh 
		terrain when they were ambushed by a well-armed and well-coordinated 
		insurgent force.</font></i></p>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#003300">While under heavy enemy 
		fire, Specialist Giunta immediately sprinted towards cover and engaged 
		the enemy.&nbsp; Seeing that his squad leader had fallen, and believing that 
		he had been injured, Specialist Giunta exposed himself to withering 
		enemy fire and raced towards his squad leader, helped him to cover and 
		administered medical aid.</font></i></p>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#003300">While administering first 
		aid, enemy fire struck Special Giunta’s body armor and his secondary 
		weapon.&nbsp; Without regard to the ongoing fire, Specialist Giunta engaged 
		the enemy before prepping and throwing grenades, using the explosions 
		for cover in order to conceal his position.</font></i></p>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#003300">Attempting to reach 
		additional wounded fellow soldiers who were separated from the squad, 
		Specialist Giunta and his team encountered a barrage of enemy fire that 
		forced them to the ground.&nbsp; The team continued forward, and upon 
		reaching the wounded soldiers, Specialist Giunta realized that another 
		soldier was still separated from the element.&nbsp; Specialist Giunta then 
		advanced forward on his own initiative.&nbsp; As he crested the top of a 
		hill, he observed two insurgents carrying away an American soldier.&nbsp; He 
		immediately engaged the enemy, killing one and wounding the other.&nbsp; Upon 
		reaching the wounded soldier, he began to provide medical aid, as his 
		squad caught up and provided security.</font></i></p>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#003300">Specialist Giunta’s 
		unwavering courage, selflessness and decisive leadership while under 
		extreme enemy fire were integral to his platoon’s ability to defeat an 
		enemy ambush and recover a fellow American soldier from the enemy.</font></i></p>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#003300">Specialist Salvatore A. 
		Giunta’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the 
		call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military 
		service and reflect great credit upon himself, Company B, 2d Battalion 
		Airborne, 503d Infantry Regiment and the United States Army.</font></i></p>
