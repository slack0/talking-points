		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning.&nbsp;Thank you very 
		much.&nbsp;Good morning.&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;Thank you so much.&nbsp;Please, have a 
		seat.&nbsp;Thank you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What a remarkable, 
		remarkable crowd.&nbsp;Thank you, Rosy, for your very kind introduction. I 
		did not know you played basketball.&nbsp;I will take your word for it.&nbsp;Rosy, 
		thank you for your many years of friendship.&nbsp;Back in Chicago, when I was 
		just getting started in national politics, I reached out to a lot of 
		people for advice and counsel, and Rosy was one of the very first.&nbsp;When 
		I made my first visit to Israel, after entering the Senate, Rosy, you 
		were at my side every step of that profound journey through the Holy 
		Land.&nbsp;So I want to thank you for your enduring friendship, your 
		leadership, and for your warm introduction today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also want to thank David 
		Victor, Howard Kohr and all the board of directors.&nbsp;And let me say that 
		it is wonderful to look out and see so many great friends, including a 
		very large delegation from Chicago.&nbsp;Alan Solow, Howard Green. Thank you 
		all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank the members 
		of Congress who are joining you today -- who do so much to sustain the 
		bonds between the United States and Israel, including Eric Cantor -- 
		Steny Hoyer -- and the tireless leader I was proud to appoint as the new 
		chair of the DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re joined by Israel’s 
		representative to the United States, 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Oren">
		<font color="#0000FF">Ambassador Michael Oren</font></a>.&nbsp;And we’re 
		joined by one of my top advisors on Israel and the Middle East for the 
		past four years and who I know is going to be an outstanding ambassador 
		to Israel, Dan Shapiro.&nbsp;Dan has always been a close and trusted advisor 
		and friend, and I know that he will do a terrific job.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And at a time when so many 
		young people around the world are standing up and making their voices 
		heard, I also want to acknowledge all the college students from across 
		the country who are here today.&nbsp;No one has a greater stake in the 
		outcome of events that are unfolding today than your generation, and 
		it’s inspiring to see you devote your time and energy to help shape that 
		future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I’m not here to subject 
		you to a long policy speech.&nbsp;I gave one on Thursday in which I said that 
		the United States sees the historic changes sweeping the Middle East and 
		North Africa as a moment of great challenge, but also a moment of 
		opportunity for greater peace and security for the entire region, 
		including the State of Israel.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On Friday, I was 
		<a href="barackobamabenjaminnetanyahujointpress.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">joined at 
		the White House by Prime Minister Netanyahu</font></a>, and we reaffirmed -- we 
		reaffirmed that fundamental truth that has guided our presidents and 
		prime ministers for more than 60 years -- that even while we may at 
		times disagree, as friends sometimes will, the bonds between the United 
		States and Israel are unbreakable -- and the commitment of the United 
		States to the security of Israel is ironclad.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A strong and secure Israel 
		is in the national security interest of the United States not simply 
		because we share strategic interests, although we do both seek a region 
		where families and children can live free from the threat of violence.&nbsp;It’s not simply because we face common dangers, although there can be no 
		denying that terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons are grave 
		threats to both our nations.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America’s commitment to 
		Israel’s security flows from a deeper place -- and that’s the values we 
		share.&nbsp;As two people who struggled to win our freedom against 
		overwhelming odds, we understand that preserving the security for which 
		our forefathers -- and foremothers -- fought must be the work of every 
		generation.&nbsp;As two vibrant democracies, we recognize that the liberties 
		and freedoms we cherish must be constantly nurtured. And as the nation 
		that recognized the State of Israel moments after its independence, we 
		have a profound commitment to its survival as a strong, secure homeland 
		for the Jewish people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also know how difficult 
		that search for security can be, especially for a small nation like 
		Israel living in a very tough neighborhood.&nbsp;I’ve seen it firsthand.&nbsp;When 
		I touched my hand against the Western Wall and placed my prayer between 
		its ancient stones, I thought of all the centuries that the children of 
		Israel had longed to return to their ancient homeland. When I went to 
		Sderot and saw the daily struggle to survive in the eyes of an 
		eight-year-old boy who lost his leg to a Hamas rocket, and when I walked 
		among the 
		<a href="http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/museum/hall_of_names.asp">
		<font color="#0000FF">Hall of Names at Yad Vashem</font></a>, I was reminded of the existential 
		fear of Israelis when a modern dictator seeks nuclear weapons and 
		threatens to wipe Israel off the face of the map -- face of the Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because we understand the 
		challenges Israel faces, I and my Administration have made the security 
		of Israel a priority.&nbsp;It’s why we’ve increased cooperation between our 
		militaries to unprecedented levels.&nbsp;It’s why we’re making our most 
		advanced technologies available to our Israeli allies.&nbsp;It’s why, despite 
		tough fiscal times, we’ve increased foreign military financing to record 
		levels.&nbsp;And that includes additional support -- beyond regular military 
		aid -– for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome">
		<font color="#0000FF">Iron Dome</font></a> anti-rocket system.&nbsp;A powerful example of 
		American-Israeli cooperation -- a powerful example of American-Israeli 
		cooperation which has already intercepted rockets from Gaza and helped 
		saved Israeli lives.&nbsp;So make no mistake, we will maintain Israel’s 
		qualitative military edge.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You also see our commitment 
		to our shared security in our determination to prevent Iran from 
		acquiring nuclear weapons.&nbsp;Here in the United States, we’ve imposed the 
		toughest sanctions ever on the Iranian regime.&nbsp;At the United Nations, 
		under our leadership, we’ve secured the most comprehensive international 
		sanctions on the regime, which have been joined by allies and partners 
		around the world.&nbsp;Today, Iran is virtually cut off from large parts of 
		the international financial system, and we’re going to keep up the 
		pressure.&nbsp;So let me be absolutely clear -- we remain committed to 
		preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Its illicit nuclear program 
		is just one challenge that Iran poses.&nbsp;As I said on Thursday, the 
		Iranian government has shown its hypocrisy by claiming to support the 
		rights of protesters while treating its own people with brutality.&nbsp;Moreover, Iran continues to support terrorism across the region, 
		including providing weapons and funds to terrorist organizations.&nbsp;So we 
		will continue to work to prevent these actions, and we will stand up to 
		groups like Hezbollah, who exercise political assassination and seek to 
		impose their will through rockets and car bombs.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamaaipac2011b.png" width="262" height="191">&nbsp;
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">You also see our commitment 
		to Israel’s security in our steadfast opposition to any attempt to 
		de-legitimize the State of Israel.&nbsp;As I said at the United 
		Nations last year, &quot;Israel’s existence must not be a subject for 
		debate,&quot; and &quot;efforts to chip away at Israel’s legitimacy will only be 
		met by the unshakeable opposition of the United States.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So when the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban_Review_Conference">
		<font color="#0000FF">Durban Review 
		Conference</font></a> advanced anti-Israel sentiment, we withdrew.&nbsp;In the wake of 
		the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstone_Report">
		<font color="#0000FF">Goldstone Report</font></a>, we stood up strongly for Israel’s right to defend 
		itself.&nbsp;When an effort was made to insert the United 
		Nations into matters that should be resolved through direct negotiations 
		between Israelis and Palestinians, we vetoed it.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so, in both word and 
		deed, we have been unwavering in our support of Israel’s security.&nbsp;And it is precisely because of our commitment to Israel’s 
		long-term security that we have worked to advance peace between Israelis 
		and Palestinians.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I have said repeatedly 
		that core issues can only be negotiated in direct talks between the 
		parties.&nbsp;And <a href="barackobamamiddleeastpolicy.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">I indicated on Thursday</font></a> that the recent 
		agreement between Fatah and Hamas poses an enormous obstacle to peace.&nbsp;No country can be expected to negotiate with a terrorist 
		organization sworn to its destruction.&nbsp;And we will 
		continue to demand that Hamas accept the basic responsibilities of 
		peace, including recognizing Israel’s right to exist and rejecting 
		violence and adhering to all existing agreements.&nbsp;And we 
		once again call on Hamas to release
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit">
		<font color="#0000FF">Gilad Shalit</font></a>, who has been kept from 
		his family for five long years.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, no matter how hard 
		it may be to start meaningful negotiations under current circumstances, 
		we must acknowledge that a failure to try is not an option. The status 
		quo is unsustainable.&nbsp;And that is why on Thursday I stated publicly the 
		principles that the United States believes can provide a foundation for 
		negotiations toward an agreement to end the conflict and all claims -- 
		the broad outlines of which have been known for many years, and have 
		been the template for discussions between the United States, Israel, and 
		the Palestinians since at least the Clinton administration.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that stating these 
		principles -- on the issues of territory and security -- generated some 
		controversy over the past few days.&nbsp;I wasn’t surprised.&nbsp;I 
		know very well that the easy thing to do, particularly for a President 
		preparing for reelection, is to avoid any controversy.&nbsp;I don’t need 
		Rahm to tell me that.&nbsp;Don’t need Axelrod to tell me that.&nbsp;But I said 
		to Prime Minister Netanyahu, I believe that the current situation in the 
		Middle East does not allow for procrastination.&nbsp;I also believe that 
		real friends talk openly and honestly with one another.&nbsp;So 
		I want to share with you some of what I said to the Prime Minister.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here are the facts we all 
		must confront.&nbsp;First, the number of Palestinians living west of the 
		Jordan River is growing rapidly and fundamentally reshaping the 
		demographic realities of both Israel and the Palestinian Territories.&nbsp;This will make it harder and harder -- without a peace deal -- to 
		maintain Israel as both a Jewish state and a democratic state.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, technology will make 
		it harder for Israel to defend itself in the absence of a genuine peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, a new generation of 
		Arabs is reshaping the region.&nbsp;A just and lasting peace can no longer 
		be forged with one or two Arab leaders.&nbsp; Going forward, millions of Arab 
		citizens have to see that peace is possible for that peace to be 
		sustained.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And just as the context has 
		changed in the Middle East, so too has it been changing in the 
		international community over the last several years.&nbsp;There’s a reason 
		why the Palestinians are pursuing their interests at the United 
		Nations.&nbsp;They recognize that there is an impatience with the peace 
		process, or the absence of one, not just in the Arab World -- in Latin 
		America, in Asia, and in Europe.&nbsp;And that impatience is growing, and 
		it’s already manifesting itself in capitals around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And those are the facts.&nbsp;I 
		firmly believe, and <a href="barackobamamiddleeastpolicy.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">I repeated on Thursday</font></a>, that peace cannot be imposed 
		on the parties to the conflict.&nbsp;No 
		<a href="../susanriceunstmtisraelisettlements.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">vote at the United Nations</font></a> will ever 
		create an independent Palestinian state.&nbsp;And the United States will 
		stand up against efforts to single Israel out at the United Nations or 
		in any international forum.&nbsp;Israel’s legitimacy is not a 
		matter for debate.&nbsp;That is my commitment; that is my pledge to all of 
		you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, we know that peace 
		demands a partner –- which is why I said that Israel cannot be expected 
		to negotiate with Palestinians who do not recognize its right to exist.&nbsp;And we will hold the Palestinians accountable for their 
		actions and for their rhetoric.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the march to isolate 
		Israel internationally -- and the impulse of the Palestinians to abandon 
		negotiations –- will continue to gain momentum in the absence of a 
		credible peace process and alternative.&nbsp;And for us to have leverage 
		with the Palestinians, to have leverage with the Arab States and with 
		the international community, the basis for negotiations has to hold out 
		the prospect of success.&nbsp;And so, in advance of a five-day trip to 
		Europe in which the Middle East will be a topic of acute interest, I 
		chose to speak about what peace will require.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There was nothing 
		particularly original in my proposal; this basic framework for 
		negotiations has long been the basis for discussions among the parties, 
		including previous U.S. administrations.&nbsp;Since questions have been 
		raised, let me repeat what I actually said on Thursday -- not what I was 
		reported to have said.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I said that the United 
		States believes that negotiations should result in two states, with 
		permanent Palestinian borders with Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, and 
		permanent Israeli borders with Palestine.&nbsp;The borders of Israel and 
		Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps 
		-- so that secure and recognized borders are established for both 
		states. The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves, 
		and reach their potential, in a sovereign and contiguous state.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		As for security, every state has the right to self-defense, and Israel 
		must be able to defend itself –- by itself -– against any threat.&nbsp;Provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a 
		resurgence of terrorism, to stop the infiltration of weapons, and to 
		provide effective border security.&nbsp;And a full and phased 
		withdrawal of Israeli military forces should be coordinated with the 
		assumption of Palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign and 
		non-militarized state.&nbsp;And the duration of this transition 
		period must be agreed, and the effectiveness of security arrangements 
		must be demonstrated.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, that is what I said.&nbsp;And it was my reference to the 1967 lines -- with mutually agreed swaps 
		-- that received the lion’s share of the attention, including just now.&nbsp;And since my position has been misrepresented several times, let me 
		reaffirm what “1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps” means.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">By definition, it means that 
		the parties themselves -– Israelis and Palestinians -– will negotiate a 
		border that is different than the one that existed on June 4, 1967.&nbsp;That’s what mutually agreed-upon swaps means.&nbsp;It is a 
		well-known formula to all who have worked on this issue for a 
		generation.&nbsp;It allows the parties themselves to account for the changes 
		that have taken place over the last 44 years.&nbsp;It allows 
		the parties themselves to take account of those changes, including the 
		new demographic realities on the ground, and the needs of both sides.&nbsp;The ultimate goal is two states for two people:&nbsp;Israel as a Jewish 
		state and the homeland for the Jewish people -- and the 
		State of Palestine as the homeland for the Palestinian people -- each 
		state in joined self-determination, mutual recognition, and peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If there is a controversy, 
		then, it’s not based in substance.&nbsp;What I did on Thursday was to say 
		publicly what has long been acknowledged privately.&nbsp;I’ve done so 
		because we can’t afford to wait another decade, or another two decades, 
		or another three decades to achieve peace.&nbsp;The world is 
		moving too fast.&nbsp;The world is moving too fast.&nbsp;The extraordinary 
		challenges facing Israel will only grow.&nbsp;Delay will undermine Israel’s 
		security and the peace that the Israeli people deserve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know that some of you 
		will disagree with this assessment.&nbsp;I respect that.&nbsp;And as fellow 
		Americans and friends of Israel, I know we can have this discussion.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ultimately, it is the right 
		and the responsibility of the Israeli government to make the hard 
		choices that are necessary to protect a Jewish and democratic state for 
		which so many generations have sacrificed.&nbsp;And as a friend 
		of Israel, I’m committed to doing our part to see that this goal is 
		realized.&nbsp;And I will call not just on Israel, but on the Palestinians, 
		on the Arab States, and the international community to join us in this 
		effort, because the burden of making hard choices must not be Israel’s 
		alone.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But even as we do all that’s 
		necessary to ensure Israel’s security, even as we are clear-eyed about 
		the difficult challenges before us, and even as we pledge to stand by 
		Israel through whatever tough days lie ahead, I hope we do not give up 
		on that vision of peace.&nbsp;For if history teaches us anything, if the 
		story of Israel teaches us anything, it is that with courage and 
		resolve, progress is possible.&nbsp;Peace is possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Talmud teaches us that, 
		&quot;So long as a person still has life, they should never abandon faith.&quot; 
		And that lesson seems especially fitting today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For so long as there are 
		those across the Middle East and beyond who are standing up for the 
		legitimate rights and freedoms which have been denied by their 
		governments, the United States will never abandon our support for those 
		rights that are universal.&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		And so long as there are those who long for a better future, we will 
		never abandon our pursuit of a just and lasting peace that ends this 
		conflict with two states living side by side in peace and security.&nbsp;This is not idealism; it is not naïveté.&nbsp;It is a hard-headed 
		recognition that a genuine peace is the only path that will ultimately 
		provide for a peaceful Palestine as the homeland of the Palestinian 
		people and a Jewish state of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish 
		people.&nbsp;That is my goal, and I look forward to continuing 
		to work with AIPAC to achieve that goal.</font></p>
