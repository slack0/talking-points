<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you. Everybody, 
		please have a seat, have a seat.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, good morning, 
		everyone.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are gathered in the 
		heart of our nation’s capital, surrounded by memorials to leaders and 
		citizens who served our nation in its earliest days and in its days of 
		greatest trial.&nbsp; Today is such a time for America.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over the past two years, 
		we have faced the worst recession since the Great Depression.&nbsp; Eight 
		million people lost their jobs.&nbsp; Tens of millions saw the value of their 
		homes and retirement savings plummet.&nbsp; Countless businesses have been 
		unable to get the loans they need and many have been forced to shut 
		their doors.&nbsp; And although the economy is growing again, too many people 
		are still feeling the pain of the downturn.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, while a number of 
		factors led to such a severe recession, the primary cause was a 
		breakdown in our financial system.&nbsp; It was a crisis born of a failure of 
		responsibility from certain corners of Wall Street to the halls of power 
		in Washington.&nbsp; For years, our financial sector was governed by 
		antiquated and poorly enforced rules that allowed some to game the 
		system and take risks that endangered the entire economy.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unscrupulous lenders 
		locked consumers into complex loans with hidden costs.&nbsp; Firms like AIG 
		placed massive, risky bets with borrowed money.&nbsp; And while the rules 
		left abuse and excess unchecked, they also left taxpayers on the hook if 
		a big bank or financial institution ever failed.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, even before the 
		crisis hit, I went to Wall Street and I called for common-sense reforms 
		to protect consumers and our economy as a whole.&nbsp; And soon after taking 
		office, I proposed a set of reforms to empower consumers and investors, 
		to bring the shadowy deals that caused this crisis into the light of 
		day, and to put a stop to taxpayer bailouts once and for all.&nbsp; 
		Today, thanks to a lot of people in this room, those reforms 
		will become the law of the land.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For the last year, 
		Chairmen Barney Frank and Chris Dodd have worked day and night. Barney and Chris have worked day and night to bring about 
		this reform.&nbsp; And I am profoundly grateful to them.&nbsp; I would be remiss 
		if I didn't also express my appreciation to Senator Harry Reid and 
		Speaker Nancy Pelosi for their leadership.&nbsp; It wouldn’t have happened 
		without them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Passing this bill was no 
		easy task.&nbsp; To get there, we had to overcome the furious lobbying of an 
		array of powerful interest groups and a partisan minority determined to 
		block change.&nbsp; So the members who are here today, both on the stage and 
		in the audience, they have done a great service in devoting so much time 
		and expertise to this effort, to looking out for the public interests 
		and not the special interests.&nbsp; And I also want to thank 
		the three Republican senators who put partisanship aside, judged this bill on the merits, and voted for reform.&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re 
		grateful to them.&nbsp; And the Republican House members.&nbsp; 
		Good to see you, Joe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let’s put this in 
		perspective.&nbsp; The fact is, the financial industry is central to our 
		nation’s ability to grow, to prosper, to compete and to innovate.&nbsp; There 
		are a lot of banks that understand and fulfill this vital role, and 
		there are a whole lot of bankers who want to do right -- and do right -- 
		by their customers.&nbsp; This reform will help foster innovation, not hamper 
		it.&nbsp; It is designed to make sure that everybody follows the same set of 
		rules, so that firms compete on price and quality, not on tricks and not 
		on traps.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It demands accountability 
		and responsibility from everyone. It provides certainty to everybody, 
		from bankers to farmers to business owners to consumers.&nbsp; And unless 
		your business model depends on cutting corners or bilking your 
		customers, you’ve got nothing to fear from reform.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, for all those 
		Americans who are wondering what Wall Street reform means for you, 
		here’s what you can expect.&nbsp; If you’ve ever applied for a credit card, a 
		student loan, or a mortgage, you know the feeling of signing your name 
		to pages of barely understandable fine print.&nbsp; What often happens as a 
		result is that many Americans are caught by hidden fees and penalties, 
		or saddled with loans they can’t afford.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s what happened to 
		Robin Fox, hit with a massive rate increase on her credit card balance 
		even though she paid her bills on time.&nbsp; That’s what happened to Andrew 
		Giordano, who discovered hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees on his 
		bank statement -- fees he had no idea he might face.&nbsp; Both are here 
		today.&nbsp; Well, with this law, unfair rate hikes, like the one that hit 
		Robin, will end for good.&nbsp; And we’ll ensure that people 
		like Andrew aren’t unwittingly caught by overdraft fees when they sign 
		up for a checking account.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With this law, we’ll crack 
		down on abusive practices in the mortgage industry.&nbsp; We’ll make sure 
		that contracts are simpler -- putting an end to many hidden penalties 
		and fees in complex mortgages -- so folks know what they’re signing.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With this law, students 
		who take out college loans will be provided clear and concise 
		information about their obligations.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And with this law, 
		ordinary investors -- like seniors and folks saving for retirement -- 
		will be able to receive more information about the costs and risks of 
		mutual funds and other investment products, so that they can make better 
		financial decisions as to what will work for them.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, all told, these 
		reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in 
		history.&nbsp; In history.&nbsp; And these protections will be 
		enforced by a new consumer watchdog with just one job:&nbsp; looking out for 
		people -- not big banks, not lenders, not investment houses -- looking 
		out for people as they interact with the financial system.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s not just good 
		for consumers; that’s good for the economy.&nbsp; Because reform will put a 
		stop to a lot of the bad loans that fueled a debt-based bubble.&nbsp; And it 
		will mean all companies will have to seek customers by offering better 
		products, instead of more deceptive ones.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, beyond the consumer 
		protections I’ve outlined, reform will also rein in the abuse and excess 
		that nearly brought down our financial system.&nbsp; It will finally bring 
		transparency to the kinds of complex and risky transactions that helped 
		trigger the financial crisis.&nbsp; Shareholders will also have a greater say 
		on the pay of CEOs and other executives, so they can reward success 
		instead of failure.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, because of 
		this law, the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill 
		for Wall Street’s mistakes.&nbsp; There will be no more 
		tax-funded bailouts -- period.&nbsp; If a large financial 
		institution should ever fail, this reform gives us the ability to wind 
		it down without endangering the broader economy.&nbsp; And there will be new 
		rules to make clear that no firm is somehow protected because it is “too 
		big to fail,” so we don’t have another AIG.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's what this reform 
		will mean.&nbsp; Now, it doesn’t mean our work is over.&nbsp; For these new rules 
		to be effective, regulators will have to be vigilant.&nbsp; We may need to 
		make adjustments along the way as our financial system adapts to these 
		new changes and changes around the globe.&nbsp; No law can force anybody to 
		be responsible; it’s still incumbent on those on Wall Street to heed the 
		lessons of this crisis in terms of how they conduct their businesses.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The fact is every American 
		-- from Main Street to Wall Street -- has a stake in our financial 
		system.&nbsp; Wall Street banks and firms invest the capital that makes it 
		possible for start-ups to sell new products.&nbsp; They provide loans to 
		businesses to expand and to hire.&nbsp; They back mortgages for families 
		purchasing a new home.&nbsp; That’s why we’ll all stand to gain from these 
		reforms.&nbsp; We all win when investors around the world have confidence in 
		our markets.&nbsp; We all win when shareholders have more power and more 
		information.&nbsp; We all win when consumers are protected against abuse.&nbsp; 
		And we all win when folks are rewarded based on how well they perform, 
		not how well they evade accountability.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end, our financial 
		system only works -- our market is only free -- when there are clear 
		rules and basic safeguards that prevent abuse, that check excess, that 
		ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the 
		system.&nbsp; And that’s what these reforms are designed to achieve -- no 
		more, no less.&nbsp; Because that’s how we will ensure that our economy works 
		for consumers, that it works for investors, that it works for financial 
		institutions -- that it works for all of us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the central lesson 
		not only of this crisis but of our history.&nbsp; Ultimately, there’s no 
		dividing line between Main Street and Wall Street.&nbsp; We rise or fall 
		together as one nation. So these reforms will help lift our economy and 
		lead all of us to a stronger, more prosperous future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why I’m so 
		honored to sign these reforms into law, and I’m so grateful to everybody 
		who worked so hard to make this day possible.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, 
		everybody.</font></p>
