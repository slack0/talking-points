<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good evening.&nbsp;Nearly 10 
		years ago, America suffered the worst attack on our shores since Pearl 
		Harbor.&nbsp;This mass murder was planned by Osama bin Laden and his al 
		Qaeda network in Afghanistan, and signaled a new threat to our security 
		–- one in which the targets were no longer soldiers on a battlefield, 
		but innocent men, women and children going about their daily lives.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the days that followed, 
		our nation was united as we struck at al Qaeda and routed the Taliban in 
		Afghanistan.&nbsp;Then, our focus shifted.&nbsp;A second war was launched in 
		Iraq, and we spent enormous blood and treasure to support a new 
		government there. By the time I took office, the war in Afghanistan had 
		entered its seventh year.&nbsp;But al Qaeda’s leaders had escaped into 
		Pakistan and were plotting new attacks, while the Taliban had regrouped 
		and gone on the offensive.&nbsp;Without a new strategy and decisive action, 
		our military commanders warned that we could face a resurgent al Qaeda 
		and a Taliban taking over large parts of Afghanistan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For this reason, in one of 
		the most difficult decisions that I’ve made as President, I ordered an 
		additional 30,000 American troops into Afghanistan.&nbsp;When 
		<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamawestpointafghanistan.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">I announced 
		this surge at West Point</font></a>, we set clear objectives:&nbsp;to refocus on al 
		Qaeda, to reverse the Taliban’s momentum, and train Afghan security 
		forces to defend their own country.&nbsp;I also made it clear that our 
		commitment would not be open-ended, and that we would begin to draw down 
		our forces this July.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tonight, I can tell you 
		that we are fulfilling that commitment.&nbsp;Thanks to our extraordinary men 
		and women in uniform, our civilian personnel, and our many coalition 
		partners, we are meeting our goals.&nbsp;As a result, starting next month, 
		we will be able to remove 10,000 of our troops from Afghanistan by the 
		end of this year, and we will bring home a total of 33,000 troops by 
		next summer, fully recovering the surge I announced at West Point.&nbsp;After this initial reduction, our troops will continue coming home at a 
		steady pace as Afghan security forces move into the lead.&nbsp; Our mission 
		will change from combat to support.&nbsp; By 2014, this process of transition 
		will be complete, and the Afghan people will be responsible for their 
		own security.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re starting this 
		drawdown from a position of strength.&nbsp;Al Qaeda is under more pressure 
		than at any time since 9/11.&nbsp;Together with the Pakistanis, we have 
		taken out more than half of al Qaeda’s leadership.&nbsp; And thanks to our 
		intelligence professionals and Special Forces, 
		<a href="barackobamaosamabinladendeath.htm"><font color="#0000FF">we killed Osama bin 
		Laden</font></a>, the only leader that al Qaeda had ever known.&nbsp;This was a victory 
		for all who have served since 9/11.&nbsp;One soldier summed it up well.&nbsp;“The message,” he said, “is we don’t forget.&nbsp;You will be held 
		accountable, no matter how long it takes.”&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The information that we 
		recovered from bin Laden’s compound shows al Qaeda under enormous 
		strain.&nbsp;Bin Laden expressed concern that al Qaeda had been unable to 
		effectively replace senior terrorists that had been killed, and that al 
		Qaeda has failed in its effort to portray America as a nation at war 
		with Islam -– thereby draining more widespread support.&nbsp;Al Qaeda 
		remains dangerous, and we must be vigilant against attacks.&nbsp;But we have 
		put al Qaeda on a path to defeat, and we will not relent until the job 
		is done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Afghanistan, we’ve 
		inflicted serious losses on the Taliban and taken a number of its 
		strongholds.&nbsp;Along with our surge, our allies also increased their 
		commitments, which helped stabilize more of the country.&nbsp;Afghan 
		security forces have grown by over 100,000 troops, and in some provinces 
		and municipalities we’ve already begun to transition responsibility for 
		security to the Afghan people.&nbsp;In the face of violence and 
		intimidation, Afghans are fighting and dying for their country, 
		establishing local police forces, opening markets and schools, creating 
		new opportunities for women and girls, and trying to turn the page on 
		decades of war.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, huge challenges 
		remain.&nbsp;This is the beginning -- but not the end –- of our effort to 
		wind down this war.&nbsp;We’ll have to do the hard work of keeping the gains 
		that we’ve made, while we draw down our forces and transition 
		responsibility for security to the Afghan government.&nbsp;And next May, in 
		Chicago, we will host a summit with our NATO allies and partners to 
		shape the next phase of this transition.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We do know that peace 
		cannot come to a land that has known so much war without a political 
		settlement.&nbsp;So as we strengthen the Afghan government and security 
		forces, America will join initiatives that reconcile the Afghan people, 
		including the Taliban.&nbsp;Our position on these talks is clear:&nbsp;They must 
		be led by the Afghan government, and those who want to be a part of a 
		peaceful Afghanistan must break from al Qaeda, abandon violence, and 
		abide by the Afghan constitution. But, in part because of our military 
		effort, we have reason to believe that progress can be made.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The goal that we seek is 
		achievable, and can be expressed simply:&nbsp;no safe haven from which al 
		Qaeda or its affiliates can launch attacks against our homeland or our 
		allies.&nbsp;We won't try to make Afghanistan a perfect place.&nbsp;We will not 
		police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely.&nbsp;That is the 
		responsibility of the Afghan government, which must step up its ability 
		to protect its people, and move from an economy shaped by war to one 
		that can sustain a lasting peace.&nbsp;What we can do, and will do, is build 
		a partnership with the Afghan people that endures –- one that ensures 
		that we will be able to continue targeting terrorists and supporting a 
		sovereign Afghan government.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, our efforts 
		must also address terrorist safe havens in Pakistan.&nbsp;No country is more 
		endangered by the presence of violent extremists, which is why we will 
		continue to press Pakistan to expand its participation in securing a 
		more peaceful future for this war-torn region.&nbsp;We'll work with the 
		Pakistani government to root out the cancer of violent extremism, and we 
		will insist that it keeps its commitments.&nbsp;For there should be no doubt 
		that so long as I am President, the United States will never tolerate a 
		safe haven for those who aim to kill us.&nbsp;They cannot elude us, nor 
		escape the justice they deserve.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My fellow Americans, this 
		has been a difficult decade for our country.&nbsp;We've learned anew the 
		profound cost of war -- a cost that's been paid by the nearly 4,500 
		Americans who have given their lives in Iraq, and the over 1,500 who 
		have done so in Afghanistan -– men and women who will not live to enjoy 
		the freedom that they defended.&nbsp;Thousands more have been wounded. Some 
		have lost limbs on the battlefield, and others still battle the demons 
		that have followed them home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet tonight, we take 
		comfort in knowing that the tide of war is receding.&nbsp; Fewer of our sons 
		and daughters are serving in harm’s way.&nbsp;We’ve ended our combat mission 
		in Iraq, with 100,000 American troops already out of that country.&nbsp;And 
		even as there will be dark days ahead in Afghanistan, the light of a 
		secure peace can be seen in the distance.&nbsp;These long wars will come to 
		a responsible end.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As they do, we must learn 
		their lessons.&nbsp;Already this decade of war has caused many to question 
		the nature of America’s engagement around the world.&nbsp;Some would have 
		America retreat from our responsibility as an anchor of global security, 
		and embrace an isolation that ignores the very real threats that we 
		face.&nbsp;Others would have America over-extended, confronting every evil 
		that can be found abroad.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We must chart a more 
		centered course.&nbsp;Like generations before, we must embrace America’s 
		singular role in the course of human events. But we must be as 
		pragmatic as we are passionate; as strategic as we are resolute.&nbsp;When 
		threatened, we must respond with force –- but when that force can be 
		targeted, we need not deploy large armies overseas.&nbsp;When innocents are 
		being slaughtered and global security endangered, we don’t have to 
		choose between standing idly by or acting on our own.&nbsp;Instead, we must 
		rally international action, which we’re doing in Libya, where we do not 
		have a single soldier on the ground, but are supporting allies in 
		protecting the Libyan people and giving them the chance to determine 
		their own destiny.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In all that we do, we must 
		remember that what sets America apart is not solely our power -– it is 
		the principles upon which our union was founded.&nbsp;We’re a nation that 
		brings our enemies to justice while adhering to the rule of law, and 
		respecting the rights of all our citizens.&nbsp;We protect our own freedom 
		and prosperity by extending it to others.&nbsp; We stand not for empire, but 
		for self-determination.&nbsp;That is why we have a stake in the democratic 
		aspirations that are now washing across the Arab world.&nbsp;We will support 
		those revolutions with fidelity to our ideals, with the power of our 
		example, and with an unwavering belief that all human beings deserve to 
		live with freedom and dignity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Above all, we are a nation 
		whose strength abroad has been anchored in opportunity for our citizens 
		here at home.&nbsp;Over the last decade, we have spent a trillion dollars on 
		war, at a time of rising debt and hard economic times.&nbsp;Now, we must 
		invest in America’s greatest resource –- our people.&nbsp;We must unleash 
		innovation that creates new jobs and industries, while living within our 
		means.&nbsp;We must rebuild our infrastructure and find new and clean 
		sources of energy.&nbsp;And most of all, after a decade of passionate 
		debate, we must recapture the common purpose that we shared at the 
		beginning of this time of war.&nbsp;For our nation draws strength from our 
		differences, and when our union is strong no hill is too steep, no 
		horizon is beyond our reach.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America, it is time to 
		focus on nation building here at home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this effort, we draw 
		inspiration from our fellow Americans who have sacrificed so much on our 
		behalf.&nbsp;To our troops, our veterans and their families, I speak for all 
		Americans when I say that we will keep our sacred trust with you, and 
		provide you with the care and benefits and opportunity that you 
		deserve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I met some of these 
		patriotic Americans at Fort Campbell.&nbsp;Awhile back, 
		<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamabagramairfield.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">I spoke to the 
		101st Airborne</font></a> that has fought to turn the tide in Afghanistan, and to 
		the team that took out Osama bin Laden.&nbsp;Standing in front of a model of 
		bin Laden’s compound, the Navy SEAL who led that effort paid tribute to 
		those who had been lost –- brothers and sisters in arms whose names are 
		now written on bases where our troops stand guard overseas, and on 
		headstones in quiet corners of our country where their memory will never 
		be forgotten.&nbsp;This officer -- like so many others I’ve met on bases, in 
		Baghdad and Bagram, and at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital -– 
		spoke with humility about how his unit worked together as one, depending 
		on each other, and trusting one another, as a family might do in a time 
		of peril.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s a lesson worth 
		remembering -– that we are all a part of one American family.&nbsp;Though we 
		have known disagreement and division, we are bound together by the creed 
		that is written into our founding documents, and a conviction that the 
		United States of America is a country that can achieve whatever it sets 
		out to accomplish.&nbsp;Now, let us finish the work at hand.&nbsp;Let us 
		responsibly end these wars, and reclaim the American Dream that is at 
		the center of our story.&nbsp;With confidence in our cause, with faith in 
		our fellow citizens, and with hope in our hearts, let us go about the 
		work of extending the promise of America -– for this generation, and the 
		next.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">May God bless our troops.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And may God bless the 
		United States of America.</font></p>
