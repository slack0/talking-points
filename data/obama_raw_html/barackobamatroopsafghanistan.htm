<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How’s it going, Bagram?&nbsp;Well, you know, it turns out that the American people, they 
		let me use this plane called Air Force One.&nbsp; And so I thought I’d come 
		over and say hello.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Couple of people I want 
		to thank, in addition to Sergeant Major Eric Johnson for the outstanding 
		introduction and his great service.&nbsp; I want to thank Major General Mike Scaparrotti.&nbsp; Thank you for your great work as commanding 
		general.&nbsp; I want to thank Ms. Dawn Liberi, who is the senior civilian 
		representative of Regional Command East, for her outstanding work; and 
		Brigadier General Steven Kwast, commander -- commander 
		455th Air Expeditionary Wing.&nbsp; Thank you all for your outstanding 
		service.&nbsp; Give them a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you for the 
		unbelievable welcome.&nbsp; I know this was on a little bit of short notice.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; No 
		worries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No worries.&nbsp; 
		It is great to be here at Bagram, and it’s great to see all 
		the services.&nbsp; We’ve got Air Force, we’ve got Army -- we’ve got Navy -- we’ve got some Marines in the house.&nbsp; 
		And we’ve got a lot of civilians here too -- who are making an outstanding contribution to this effort, and I’m 
		honored to be joined by America’s outstanding civilian military 
		leadership team here in Afghanistan, Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, who’s 
		doing outstanding work, and the commander of our 43-nation coalition, 
		General Stan McChrystal.&nbsp; The two of them together have paired up to do 
		an extraordinarily difficult task, but they are doing it extraordinarily 
		well and we are proud of them.&nbsp; Please give your outstanding team a big 
		round of applause.&nbsp; They’ve got my full confidence and my full support.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We’re also joined by 
		troops from some of our coalition partners, because this is not simply 
		an American mission or even just a NATO mission.&nbsp; Al Qaeda and their 
		extremist allies are a threat to the people of Afghanistan and a threat 
		to the people of America, but they’re also a threat to people all around 
		the world, and that’s why we’re so proud to have our coalition partners 
		here with us.&nbsp; Thank you very much for the great work that you do.&nbsp; We 
		salute you and we honor you for all the sacrifices you make, and you are 
		a true friend of the United States of America.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And we also salute the 
		members of the Afghan National Army who are fighting alongside all of 
		you.&nbsp; They’re risking their lives to protect their country.&nbsp; And as I 
		told President Karzai today, the United States is a partner but our 
		intent is to make sure that the Afghans have the capacity to provide for 
		their own security.&nbsp; That is core to our mission, and we are proud of 
		the work that they are doing and the continuing increased capacity that 
		we’re seeing out of Afghan national security forces.&nbsp; So thank you very 
		much for the great work you’re doing to take responsibility for security 
		here in your own country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And to the Afghan 
		people, I want to say that I’m honored to be a guest in your country.&nbsp; 
		Now, the Afghans have suffered for decades -- decades of war.&nbsp; But we 
		are here to help Afghans forge a hard-won peace while realizing the 
		extraordinary potential of the Afghan people, Afghanistan’s sons and 
		daughters, from the soldiers and the police to the farmers and the young 
		students.&nbsp; And we want to build a lasting partnership founded upon 
		mutual interests and mutual respect, and I’m looking forward to 
		returning to Afghanistan many times in the years to come.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, I know for most of 
		you, you didn’t get a lot of notice that I was coming.&nbsp; But I want you 
		to understand, there’s no visit that I considered more important than 
		this visit I’m making right now, because I have no greater honor than 
		serving as your Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; And it is a privilege to look out 
		and see the extraordinary efforts of America’s sons and daughters here 
		in Afghanistan.&nbsp; So my main job here today is to say thank you on behalf 
		of the entire American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You are part of the 
		finest military in the history of the world, and we are proud of you.&nbsp; 
		And so I want you to know that everybody back home is proud of you.&nbsp; 
		Everybody back home is grateful.&nbsp; And everybody understands the 
		sacrifices that you have made and your families have made to keep 
		America safe and to keep America secure in this vital mission.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And I know it’s not 
		easy.&nbsp; You’re far away from home.&nbsp; You miss your kids.&nbsp; You miss your 
		spouses, your family, your friends.&nbsp; Some of you, this is your second or 
		your third or your fourth tour of duty.&nbsp; I’ll tell you right now the 
		same thing that I said at West Point last December.&nbsp; If I thought for a 
		minute that America’s vital interests were not served, were not at stake 
		here in Afghanistan, I would order all of you home right away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So I want you to know, 
		I want every American serving in Afghanistan, military and civilian, to 
		know, whether you’re working the flight line here at Bagram or 
		patrolling a village down in Helmand, whether you’re standing watch at a 
		forward operating base or training our Afghan partners or working with 
		the Afghan government, your services are absolutely necessary, 
		absolutely essential to America’s safety and security.&nbsp; Those folks back 
		home are relying on you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We can’t forget why 
		we’re here.&nbsp; We did not choose this war.&nbsp; This was not an act of America 
		wanting to expand its influence; of us wanting to meddle in somebody 
		else’s business.&nbsp; We were attacked viciously on 9/11.&nbsp; Thousands of our 
		fellow countrymen and women were killed.&nbsp; And this is the region where 
		the perpetrators of that crime, al Qaeda, still base their leadership.&nbsp; 
		Plots against our homeland, plots against our allies, plots against the 
		Afghan and Pakistani people are taking place as we speak right here.&nbsp; 
		And if this region slides backwards, if the Taliban retakes this country 
		and al Qaeda can operate with impunity, then more American lives will be 
		at stake.&nbsp; The Afghan people will lose their chance at progress and 
		prosperity.&nbsp; And the world will be significantly less secure.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And as long as I’m your 
		Commander-in-Chief, I am not going to let that happen.&nbsp; That’s why you 
		are here.&nbsp; I’ve made a promise to all of you who serve.&nbsp; I will never 
		send you into harm’s way unless it’s absolutely necessary.&nbsp; I anguish in 
		thinking about the sacrifices that so many of you make.&nbsp; That’s why I 
		promise I will never send you out unless it is necessary.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But that’s only part of 
		the promise, because the other part of the promise is that when it is 
		absolutely necessary, you will be backed up by a clear mission and the 
		right strategy to finish the job, to get the job done.&nbsp; And I am 
		confident all of you are going to get the job done right here in 
		Afghanistan.&nbsp; I am confident of that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s why I ordered 
		more troops and civilians here into Afghanistan shortly after taking 
		office.&nbsp; That’s why we took a hard look and forged a new strategy and 
		committed more resources in December.&nbsp; That’s why we pushed our friends 
		and allies and partners to pony up more resources themselves, more 
		commitments of aid, and additional forces and trainers.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our broad mission is 
		clear:&nbsp; We are going to disrupt and dismantle, defeat and destroy al 
		Qaeda and its extremist allies.&nbsp; That is our mission.&nbsp; And to accomplish 
		that goal, our objectives here in Afghanistan are also clear:&nbsp; We’re 
		going to deny al Qaeda safe haven.&nbsp; We’re going to reverse the Taliban’s 
		momentum.&nbsp; We’re going to strengthen the capacity of Afghan security 
		forces and the Afghan government so that they can begin taking 
		responsibility and gain confidence of the Afghan people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And our strategy 
		includes a military effort that takes the fight to the Taliban while 
		creating the conditions for greater security and a transition to the 
		Afghans; but also a civilian effort that improves the daily lives of the 
		Afghan people, and combats corruption; and a partnership with Pakistan 
		and its people, because we can’t uproot extremists and advance security 
		and opportunity unless we succeed on both sides of the border.&nbsp; Most of 
		you understand that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many of the troops that 
		I ordered to Afghanistan have begun to arrive, and more are on the way.&nbsp; 
		And we’ll continue to work with Congress to make sure that you’ve got 
		the equipment that you need, particularly as we complete our drawdown in 
		Iraq.&nbsp; We’re providing more helicopters, we’re providing more 
		intelligence and reconnaissance capabilities, more special operations 
		forces, more armored vehicles that can save lives.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And here in Afghanistan 
		you’ve gone on the offensive.&nbsp; And the American people back home are 
		noticing.&nbsp; We have seen a huge increase in support in -- stateside, 
		because people understand the kinds of sacrifices that you guys are 
		making, and the clarity of mission that you’re bringing to bear.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And together with our 
		coalition and Afghan partners, our troops have pushed the Taliban out of 
		their stronghold in Marja.&nbsp; We’ve changed the way we operate and 
		interact with the Afghan people.&nbsp; We see Afghans reclaiming their 
		communities, and we see new partnerships that will help them build their 
		own future and increase their security.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And across the border, 
		Pakistan is mounting major offensives.&nbsp; We’ve seen violent extremists 
		pushed out of their sanctuaries.&nbsp; We’ve struck major blows against al 
		Qaeda leadership as well as the Taliban’s.&nbsp; They are hunkered down.&nbsp; 
		They’re worried about their own safety.&nbsp; It’s harder for them to move, 
		it’s harder for them to train and to plot and to attack, and all of that 
		makes America safer.&nbsp; And we are going to keep them on the run because 
		that is what’s going to be required in order to assure that our families 
		back home have the security that they need.&nbsp; That’s the work that you 
		are doing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So thanks to you, there’s 
		been progress these last several months.&nbsp; But we know there are 
		going to be some difficult days ahead.&nbsp; There’s going to be 
		setbacks.&nbsp; We face a determined enemy.&nbsp; But we also know this:&nbsp; 
		The United States of America does not quit once it starts on something.&nbsp; 
		You don’t quit, the American armed services does not quit, we keep at 
		it, we persevere, and together with our partners we will prevail.&nbsp; 
		I am absolutely confident of that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And I also want you to know 
		that as you’re doing your duty here, we’re going to do right by you back 
		home.&nbsp; We’re going to help take care of your families, and that’s why 
		the First Lady Michelle Obama visited with military families and makes 
		sure that their needs are met.&nbsp; That’s why she stays after me once she 
		gets home, when I’m at the White House.&nbsp; And we’re going to make sure 
		that we are keeping to improve your pay and your benefits, but also 
		things like childcare and support that ensure that you’ve got a little 
		bit of security knowing your family is being looked after back home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And we’ll be there for your 
		when you come home.&nbsp; It’s why we’re improving care for our wounded 
		warriors, especially those with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.&nbsp; 
		We’re moving forward with the Post-9/11 GI Bill so you and your families 
		can pursue your dreams.&nbsp; And we’ve made the biggest increase in the VA 
		budget in 30 years, because we’re going to keep our sacred trust with 
		all those who serve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You’ve been there for us, 
		tour after tour, year after year, at a time when too many American 
		institutions have let us down, when too many institutions have put 
		short-term gain in front of a commitment to duty and a commitment to 
		what’s right.&nbsp; You’ve met your responsibilities, you’ve done your duty 
		-- not just when it’s easy.&nbsp; That’s why you’ve inspired your fellow 
		Americans.&nbsp; That’s why you inspire me.&nbsp; That’s why you’ve earned your 
		place next to the very greatest of American generations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And all of you represent the 
		virtues and the values that America so desperately needs right now:&nbsp; 
		sacrifice and selflessness, honor and decency.&nbsp; That’s why you’re here 
		today.&nbsp; That’s what you represent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I’ve seen your sense of 
		purpose and your willingness to step forward and serve in a time of 
		danger.&nbsp; I’ve seen it from the Marines I’ve met at Camp Lejeune to the 
		cadets at West Point, from the midshipmen at Annapolis to the troops 
		I’ve met in Iraq, and at bases across America and here in Afghanistan.&nbsp; 
		I’ve seen your courage and your heroism and the story of a young 
		Sergeant First Class named Jared Monti who gave his life here in 
		Afghanistan to save his fellow soldiers and his parents.&nbsp; I was proud to 
		present with our nation’s highest military declaration, the Medal of 
		Honor.&nbsp; I’ve seen your tenacity -- I’ve seen your tenacity 
		and determination in our wounded warriors in Landstuhl and Walter Reed 
		-- Americans fighting to stand again and to walk again and to get back 
		with -- get back with their units; incredible dedication, incredible 
		focus, incredible pride.&nbsp; And I’ve been humbled by your sacrifice and 
		the solemn homecoming of flag-draped coffins at Dover, to the headstones 
		in Section 60 at Arlington where the fallen from this war rest in peace 
		alongside the fellow heroes of America’s story.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So here in Afghanistan 
		each one of you is part of an unbroken line of American service members 
		who’ve sacrificed for over two centuries.&nbsp; You’re protecting your fellow 
		citizens from danger.&nbsp; You’re serving alongside old allies and new 
		friends.&nbsp; You’re bringing hope and opportunity to a people who have 
		known a lot of pain and a lot of suffering.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And I know that 
		sometimes when you’re watching TV, the politics back home may look a 
		little messy, and people are yelling and hollering, and Democrats this 
		and Republicans that.&nbsp; I want you to understand this:&nbsp; There’s no 
		daylight when it comes to support of all of you.&nbsp; There’s no daylight 
		when it comes to supporting our troops.&nbsp; That brings us together.&nbsp; We 
		are all incredibly proud.&nbsp; We all honor what you do.&nbsp; And all of you 
		show all of America what’s possible when people come together, not based 
		on color or creed, not based on faith or station, but based on a 
		commitment to serve together, to bleed together and to succeed together 
		as one people, as Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Make no mistake, this 
		fight matters to us.&nbsp; It matters to us, it matters to our allies, it 
		matters to the Afghan people.&nbsp; Al Qaeda and the violent extremists who 
		you’re fighting against want to destroy.&nbsp; But all of you want to build 
		-- and that is something essential about America.&nbsp; They’ve got no 
		respect for human life.&nbsp; You see dignity in every human being.&nbsp; That’s 
		part of what we value as Americans.&nbsp; They want to drive races and 
		regions and religions apart.&nbsp; You want to bring people together and see 
		the world move forward together.&nbsp; They offer fear, in other words, and 
		you offer hope.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that’s why it is so 
		important that you know that the entire country stands behind you.&nbsp; 
		That’s why you put on that uniform, because in an uncertain world, the 
		United States of America will always stand up for the security of 
		nations and the dignity of human beings.&nbsp; That’s who we are.&nbsp; That is 
		what we do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much has happened to our 
		country and to the world since 9/11.&nbsp; But I’m confident that so long as 
		brave men and women like you -- Americans who are willing to serve 
		selflessly half a world away on behalf of their fellow citizens and the 
		dreams of people they’ve never met -- so long as there are folks like 
		you, then I’m confident that our nation will endure, and hope will 
		overcome fear.&nbsp; And I am confident that better days lie ahead.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So thank you very much, 
		everybody.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; God bless the United States Armed Forces.&nbsp; 
		And God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
