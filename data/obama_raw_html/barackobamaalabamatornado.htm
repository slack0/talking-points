		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, Michelle and I want to 
		express, first of all, our deepest condolences to not just the city of 
		Tuscaloosa but the state of Alabama and all the other states that have 
		been affected by this unbelievable storm. We just took a tour, and I’ve 
		got to say I’ve never seen devastation like this.&nbsp;It is heartbreaking.&nbsp;We were just talking to some residents here who were lucky enough to 
		escape alive, but have lost everything.&nbsp; They mentioned that their 
		neighbors had lost two of their grandchildren in the process.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		What you’re seeing here is the consequence of just a few minutes of this 
		extraordinarily powerful storm sweeping through this community.&nbsp;And as 
		the governor was mentioning, Tuscaloosa typically gets a tornado during 
		the season, but this is something that I don’t think anybody has seen 
		before.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		In addition to keeping all the families who’ve been affected in our 
		thoughts and prayers, obviously our biggest priority now is to help this 
		community recover. I want to thank Mayor Maddox for his extraordinary 
		leadership. Chief Burgess [ph] I know is having to dealing with a lot 
		of difficulties. One of the challenges that the mayor was explaining 
		is, is that the assets of the city -- a fire station that we passed on 
		the way in, police resources, emergency resources -- those too have been 
		affected.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
		Fortunately the governor has done an extraordinary job with his team in 
		making sure that the resources of the state are mobilized and have been 
		brought in here. I’m very pleased that we’ve got a FEMA director in 
		Craig Fugate who is as experienced as anybody in responding to disasters 
		even of this magnitude.&nbsp;And we’ve already provided the disaster 
		designations -- we’ve already provided the disaster designations that 
		are required to make sure that the maximum federal help comes here as 
		quickly as possible.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Craig is working with the teams on the ground to make sure that we are 
		seamlessly coordinating between the state, local and federal 
		governments.&nbsp;And I want to just make a commitment to the communities 
		here that we are going to do everything we can to help these communities 
		rebuild.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		We can’t bring those who have been lost back.&nbsp;They’re alongside God at 
		this point.&nbsp; We can help maybe a little bit with the families dealing 
		with the grief of having a loved one lost.&nbsp;But the property damage, 
		which is obviously extensive, that's something that we can do something 
		about.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And so we’re going to do everything we can to partner with you, Mr. 
		Mayor, with you, governor. As the governor was pointing out, this 
		community was hit as bad as any place, but there are communities all 
		across Alabama and all across this region that have been affected, and 
		we’re going to be making that same commitment to make sure that we’re 
		doing whatever we can to make sure that people are okay.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		That bee likes you.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		GOVERNOR BENTLEY:&nbsp;It’s a wasp.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;Okay, got it.&nbsp;There you go.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		GOVERNOR BENTLEY:&nbsp;No, he got him away.&nbsp;You didn’t get him.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		MAYOR MADDOX:&nbsp;Where’s the Secret Service when you need them?<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;Finally, let me just say this.&nbsp;As you walk around, we 
		were just talking to three young people over there -- college students 
		here at the University of Alabama who are volunteering now to help clean 
		up.&nbsp;One of the young ladies there, she actually lived in this 
		apartment; wasn’t here at the time the storm happened.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		What you’re struck by is people’s resilience and the way that the 
		community has come together. And obviously that's testimony to the 
		leadership of the governor and the mayor, but it’s also inherent as part 
		of the American spirit.&nbsp;We go through hard times, but no matter how 
		hard we may be tested, we maintain our faith and we look to each other 
		to make sure that we’re supporting each other and helping each other.&nbsp; 
		I’m sure that that spirit is going to continue until this city is all 
		the way back.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So, Mr. Mayor -- he was pointing out that there’s a lot of national 
		media down here now, and the mayor expressed the concern that perhaps 
		the media will move on in a day or a week or a month, and that folks 
		will forget what’s happened here. And I want to assure him that the 
		American people all across the country are with him and his community, 
		and we’re going to make sure that you’re not forgotten and that we do 
		everything we can to make sure that we rebuild.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So with that, Governor, would you like to say a few words?<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		GOVERNOR BENTLEY:&nbsp;I would.&nbsp;And, Mr. President, I would like to 
		personally thank you and Mrs. Obama for coming and visiting Alabama 
		because you know as you fly over this -- and I did yesterday -- as you 
		fly over it from the air, it does not do it justice until you’re here on 
		the ground.&nbsp;And I just want you to know how much I appreciate that.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		We asked for -- we’ve mobilized the state.&nbsp;We declared a state of 
		emergency early on, even before the first tornadoes hit, and then we 
		mobilized our National Guard the first day.&nbsp;We then asked the President 
		for aid and we asked him to expedite that, and they have done that.&nbsp;And 
		I just want you to know how much I appreciate that, Mr. President, 
		because all these people appreciate that so much.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		We have eight counties across the state that have been hit by major 
		tornadoes.&nbsp;This probably is the worst one, but we have others. As you 
		go across the state, you see the same evidence of tornadoes all across 
		the state.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And so there are people that are hurting.&nbsp;We have now 210 confirmed 
		deaths in Alabama.&nbsp;We have 1,700 injured.&nbsp;We have a number of people 
		missing at the present time. We’re going to continue to work in a 
		rescue-type mode, but we’re now more in a recovery mode.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp;If you’ll keep him off of me --<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;I’m going to keep my eye on you.&nbsp;We’re looking out for 
		each other. That's --<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		GOVERNOR BENTLEY: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		But I am -- let me say I am so proud of our first responders in this 
		state.&nbsp;They have done an outstanding job.&nbsp;Our mayors, our county 
		commissioners, our police, our firemen -- they have all just done a 
		fantastic job. Our EMA people, they have just -- we have got a great 
		team.&nbsp;They’ve all worked together. And now we have the federal 
		government helping us.&nbsp;And, you know, that just shows when locals and 
		state and federal government works together, we can get things 
		accomplished, and that's what we’re going to do.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And so, Mr. President, welcome to Alabama, but not under these 
		circumstances.&nbsp; We want you to come back and maybe go to a football game 
		over here at a later day and when things are better. But thank you for 
		your help.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;I will gladly come back.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		GOVERNOR BENTLEY:&nbsp;Thank you, sir.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;Mr. Mayor, if you’d like to say a few words.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		MAYOR MADDOX: Mr. President, Governor, Mrs. Obama, thank you for coming 
		today.&nbsp;The last 36 hours have been probably the most trying time in 
		this community’s history.&nbsp;But you’re going to see a new story being 
		written here in Tuscaloosa.&nbsp;And in the years to come these chapters are 
		going to be fueled with hope and opportunity.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Since this tragedy began, I’ve been using Romans 12:12 when Paul wrote 
		under persecution, “Rejoice in our confident hope.”&nbsp;Well, today, Mr. 
		President, your visit here has brought a confident hope to this 
		community. And in the days, weeks and months to come, we’re going to be 
		a story that you’re going to be very proud of and you can talk about 
		across this land.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Thank you again for coming today.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp;Well, thank you for your leadership.&nbsp;And two last 
		points I want to make.&nbsp;First of all, we’ve got our congressional 
		delegation here, and I am absolutely confident that they will make sure 
		that the resources are available to help rebuild.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		To all the local officials who are here, I know that they’ve been 
		personally affected, but I know that they’re going to provide the 
		leadership in this community, working with the mayor and the governor to 
		do what is needed.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And finally, I think the mayor said something very profound as we were 
		driving over here.&nbsp;He said, what's amazing is when something like this 
		happens, folks forget all their petty differences. Politics, 
		differences of religion or race, all that fades away when we are 
		confronted with the awesome power of nature. And we’re reminded that 
		all we have is each other.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And so hopefully that spirit continues and grows. If nothing else comes 
		out of this tragedy, let’s hope that that's one of the things that comes 
		out.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So thank you very much, everybody.</font></p>
