		<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good afternoon, everybody.&nbsp; 
		I know it’s a little warm out here so want to get started.&nbsp; I’ve just 
		had a meeting with these governors, members of Congress, local 
		officials, as well as Admiral Thad Allen, the National Incident 
		Commander in charge of response efforts to the BP oil spill.&nbsp; Admiral 
		Allen gave us an update, the latest information on both the efforts to 
		plug the well, as well as giving us an update on arrangements and 
		coordination that's being made with respect to mitigating this damage 
		that's been done.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">He updated us on these 
		latest efforts to stop the leak, mitigate the damage to the great 
		beaches of the Gulf coast, and I had the chance to visit with -- 
		Charlotte -- a beach like Port Fourchon that gives you a sense of what 
		extraordinary efforts are being made at the local level, but also the 
		damage that we're already starting to see as a consequence of this 
		spill.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, our mission remains the 
		same as it has since this disaster began, since the day I visited 
		Louisiana nearly four weeks ago:&nbsp; We want to stop the leak; we want to 
		contain and clean up the oil; and we want to help the people of this 
		region return to their lives and their livelihoods as soon as possible.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And our response treats this 
		event for what it is:&nbsp; It’s an assault on our shores, on our people, on 
		the regional economy, and on communities like this one.&nbsp; This isn’t just 
		a mess that we’ve got to mop up.&nbsp; People are watching their livelihoods 
		wash up on the beach.&nbsp; Parents are worried about the implications for 
		their children’s health.&nbsp; Every resident of this community has watched 
		this nightmare threaten the dreams that they’ve worked so hard to 
		build.&nbsp; And they want it made right, and they want to make it right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I just had a chance to 
		listen to Mayor David Carmadelle of Grande Isle, our host here, telling 
		us heartbreaking stories about fishermen who are trying to figure out 
		where the next paycheck is going to come from, how are they going to pay 
		a mortgage or a note on their boat.&nbsp; And he is having to dig into his 
		pocket at this point to make sure that some of them are able to deal 
		with the economic impact.&nbsp; So this is something that has to be dealt 
		with immediately, not sometime later.&nbsp; And that’s everybody’s driving 
		focus -- everybody who is standing behind me. This is our highest 
		priority and it deserves a response that is equal to the task.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why this has already 
		been the largest cleanup effort in U.S. history.&nbsp; On the day this 
		disaster began, even as we launched a search and rescue effort for 
		workers on the drilling rig, we were already staging equipment in the 
		event of a larger-scale spill.&nbsp; By the time we discovered the third 
		breach, a week after the Deepwater Horizon platform sank, we had already 
		stationed more than 70 vessels and hundreds of thousands of feet of 
		protective boom on site.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, there are more than 
		20,000 people in the region working around the clock to contain and 
		clean up this spill.&nbsp; We’ve activated about 1,400 members of the 
		National Guard across four states.&nbsp; Nearly 1,400 vessels are aiding in 
		the containment and cleanup effort.&nbsp; And we deployed more than 3 million 
		feet of hard and sorbent boom, including an additional 100,000 just 
		yesterday for these parishes in Louisiana that face the greatest 
		threat.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I’ve made clear to 
		Admiral Allen and I did so again today that he should get whatever he 
		needs to deal with this crisis.&nbsp; Whatever he needs, he will get.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Right now, we’re still 
		within the window where we don’t yet know the outcome of the highly 
		complex top kill procedure that the federal government authorized BP to 
		use to try to stop the leak.&nbsp; If it is successful, it would obviously be 
		welcome news.&nbsp; If it’s not, a team of some of the world’s top 
		scientists, engineers and experts, led by our Energy Secretary and Nobel 
		Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, has for some time being -- has for 
		some time been exploring any and all reasonable contingency plans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But our response will 
		continue with its full force regardless of the outcome of the top kill 
		approach -- because even if the leak was stopped today it wouldn’t 
		change the fact that these waters still contain oil from what is now the 
		largest spill in American history.&nbsp; And more of it will come ashore.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To ensure that we’re fully 
		prepared for that, and in accordance with input from folks down here, 
		I’ve directed Secretary Napolitano and Admiral Allen to triple the 
		manpower in places where oil has hit the shore or is within 24 hours of 
		impact.&nbsp; This increase will allow us to further intensify this already 
		historic response, contain and remove oil more quickly, and help 
		minimize the time that any oil comes into contact with our coastline.&nbsp; 
		That means deploying more boom, cleaning more beaches, performing more 
		monitoring of wildlife and impact to this ecosystem.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re also going to continue 
		to do whatever it takes to help Americans whose livelihoods have been 
		upended by this spill.&nbsp; Gulf Coast residents should know that we’ve 
		gathered all pertinent information regarding available assistance and 
		the federal response in one place at whitehouse.gov.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have ordered BP to pay 
		economic injury claims, and we will make sure they deliver.&nbsp; And the 
		parish presidents and governors here in Louisiana were already giving us 
		some sense of some of the bureaucratic problems that we’re going to have 
		to cut through, but we are going to cut through them.&nbsp; And for those who 
		are in economic distress, if you’ve already filed a claim and you’re not 
		satisfied with the resolution, then whitehouse.gov will point you in the 
		right direction.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As I said yesterday, the 
		Small Business Administration has stepped in to help businesses by 
		approving loans, but also as important, allowing many to defer existing 
		loan payments.&nbsp; A lot of folks are still loaded up with loans that they 
		had from Katrina and other natural disasters down here, so they may need 
		some additional help.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you’re a small business 
		owner and you weren’t aware of some of the programs that have been put 
		in place or haven’t participated, then, again, the White House website 
		will connect you to the resources you need.&nbsp; And we are making sure that 
		all the parish presidents know, and folks like the mayor, other local 
		officials are going to be aware of how they can get immediate help from 
		us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What’s more, we’ve stationed 
		doctors and scientists across the five Gulf States to look out for 
		people’s health and then to monitor any ill effects felt by cleanup 
		workers and local residents.&nbsp; And we’ve begun setting up a system to 
		track these efforts -- excuse me, to track these effects -- and ensure 
		folks get the care that they need.&nbsp; And we’ve told BP that we expect 
		them to pay for that, too.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As I’ve said before, BP is 
		the responsible party for this disaster.&nbsp; What that means is they’re 
		legally responsible for stopping the leak and they’re financially 
		responsible for the enormous damage that they’ve created.&nbsp; And we’re 
		going to hold them accountable, along with any other party responsible 
		for the initial explosion and loss of life on that platform.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But as I said yesterday, and 
		as I repeated in the meeting that we just left, I ultimately take 
		responsibility for solving this crisis.&nbsp; I’m the President and the buck 
		stops with me.&nbsp; So I give the people of this community and the entire 
		Gulf my word that we’re going to hold ourselves accountable to do 
		whatever it takes for as long as it takes to stop this catastrophe, to 
		defend our natural resources, to repair the damage, and to keep this 
		region on its feet.&nbsp; Justice will be done for those whose lives have 
		been upended by this disaster, for the families of those whose lives 
		have been lost -- that is a solemn pledge that I am making.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think I can speak for 
		anybody here, and for anybody who has been involved in the response and 
		the cleanup effort, and for most Americans, when I say that I would 
		gladly do whatever it takes to end this disaster today.&nbsp; But I want to 
		also repeat something that I said to the group as a whole while we were 
		meeting.&nbsp; This is a manmade catastrophe that’s still evolving and we 
		face a long-term recovery and restoration effort.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America has never 
		experienced an event like this before.&nbsp; And that means that as we 
		respond to it, not every judgment we make is going to be right the first 
		time out.&nbsp; Sometimes, there are going to be disagreements between 
		experts, or between federal and state and local officials, or among 
		state officials, or between states, about what the most effective 
		measures will be.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sometimes, there are going 
		to be risks and unintended consequences associated with a particular 
		mitigation strategy that we consider.&nbsp; In other words, there are going 
		to be a lot of judgment calls involved here.&nbsp; There are not going to be 
		silver bullets or a lot of perfect answers for some of the challenges 
		that we face.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Understandably, the feelings 
		of frustration and anger, the sense that any response is inadequate -- 
		we expect that frustration and anger to continue until we actually solve 
		this problem.&nbsp; But in the meantime, we’ve got to make sure that 
		everybody is working in concert, that everybody is moving in the same 
		direction.&nbsp; And I want everybody to know that everybody here -- at every 
		level -- is working night and day to end this crisis. We’re considering 
		every single idea out there, especially from folks who know these 
		communities best.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Admiral Allen announced 
		yesterday, for example, that, after a bunch of back-and-forth between 
		state and federal experts, he is prepared to authorize moving forward 
		with a portion of the idea for a barrier island that may stop some of 
		the oil from coming ashore.&nbsp; We had an extensive conversation about this 
		and&nbsp;-- to see whether additional steps can be taken on this barrier 
		island idea.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And what I told the parish 
		president, what I told the Governor, is that if there is an idea that 
		can be shown to work, then we should move forward on it, and they 
		deserve quick answers.&nbsp; But I also reminded everybody that we’ve got to 
		make sure that whatever we do is actually going to work, particularly 
		because we’re going to have not unlimited resources, at least not right 
		now.&nbsp; For example, there’s a limited amount of boom.&nbsp; We’re going to try 
		to get more boom manufactured.&nbsp; But that may take some time, and that 
		means we’re going to have to make some decisions about how to deploy it 
		effectively.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The bottom line is this:&nbsp; 
		Every decision we make is based on a single criterion -- what’s going to 
		best protect and make whole the people and the ecosystems of the Gulf.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I want to thank 
		everybody in this region who’s rolled up their sleeves and pitched in to 
		help -- from the National Guard putting their experience to the task, to 
		the local officials and every citizen who loves this area and calls it 
		home, every American who’s traveled to the region to lend a hand.&nbsp; If 
		any American is looking for ways to volunteer and help, then we’ve put 
		links to that information on our website, as well -- that's whitehouse.gov.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, all these governors -- 
		Bobby Jindal, as well as Charlie Crist and Bob Riley, they want -- and I 
		know Haley Barbour is not here but I think he agrees with this, as well 
		-- one of the powerful ways that you can help the Gulf right now is to 
		visit the communities and the beaches off of the coast.&nbsp; Except for 
		three beaches here in Louisiana, all of the Gulf’s beaches at this 
		moment are open, they are safe and they are clean.&nbsp; And so that's always 
		a good way to help, is to come down and provide support to the 
		communities along the coasts.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To the people of the Gulf 
		Coast:&nbsp; I know that you’ve weathered your fair share of trials and 
		tragedy.&nbsp; I know there have been times where you’ve wondered if you were 
		being asked to face them alone.&nbsp; I am here to tell you that you’re not 
		alone.&nbsp; You will not be abandoned.&nbsp; You will not be left behind.&nbsp; The 
		cameras at some point may leave; the media may get tired of the story; 
		but we will not.&nbsp; We are on your side and we will see this through.&nbsp; 
		We’re going to keep at this every day until the leak has stopped, until 
		this coastline is clean, and your communities are made whole again.&nbsp; 
		That’s my promise to you.&nbsp; And that is a promise on behalf of a nation.&nbsp; 
		It is one that we will keep.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I will make one last 
		point -- and I said this to every leader who is here:&nbsp; If something is 
		not going right down here, then they need to talk to Thad Allen.&nbsp; And if 
		they’re not getting satisfaction from Thad Allen, then they can talk to 
		me.&nbsp; There’s nobody here who can’t get in touch with me directly if 
		there is an idea, a suggestion, or a logjam that needs to be dealt with.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we’re in this together.&nbsp; 
		And it’s going to be a difficult time, and obviously the folks down here 
		are going to be feeling the brunt of it, but we’re going to make sure 
		that we’re doing everything we can to get this solved as quickly as 
		possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I want to again think 
		everybody here for the extraordinary work that they’re putting in.&nbsp; You 
		shouldn’t underestimate how hard these folks are working, day in, day 
		out, on behalf of their constituencies.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So thank you very much.&nbsp; 
		Thank you, everybody.</font></p>
