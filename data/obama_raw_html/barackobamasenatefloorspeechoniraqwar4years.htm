			</font>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you very much, Mr. 
		President. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mr. President, on Thursdays Senator Durbin 
		and I hold a constituent coffee so we can hear from the folks back home. 
		A young man came a few months ago who was about 25, 26 years old. He had 
		been in Iraq for a year -- The first -- He had 
		been back from Iraq for a year. The first six months of that year had 
		been spent 
		in a coma. An explosion had shattered his face, blinded him in both 
		eyes, has left him without the use of one arm.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">He talked to us about how he was 
		going through rehab. He introduced us to his family. He has a wife 
		and two young daughters like I do, and his wife talked for a bit about 
		the adjustments they were making at home since dad got hurt. And I found 
		myself looking at not just him, but his wife, who loves him so much. And I thought about how their lives were forever changed because of the 
		decision that was carried out four years ago.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The sacrifices of war are 
		immeasurable. I first made this point in 
		the fall of 2002, at the end of the 
		<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Barack_Obama's_Iraq_Speech">
		<font color="#0000FF">speech that I gave opposing the invasion 
		of Iraq</font></a>. I said then that I certainly do not oppose all wars. 
		Rather, I oppose dumb 
		wars, rash wars, wars that are based on passion as opposed to wars based 
		on a sober assessment of our national security interests, because there's no decision more profound than the 
		one we make to send our brave men and women into harm’s way. I’ve thought about these 
		words from time to time since that speech, but never so much as the day 
		I saw that young man and his wife, and understood the degree to which 
		their lives had been turn upside down.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The sacrifices of war are 
		immeasurable. Too many have returned from Iraq with that soldier’s story 
		-- with broken bodies and shattered nerves and wounds that even the best 
		care may not heal. Too many of our best have come home shrouded in the 
		flag they loved. Too many moms and dads and husbands and wives have 
		answered that knock on the door that’s hardest for any loved one to 
		hear. And the rest of us have seen too many promises of swift victories 
		and dying insurgencies and budding democracy giving way to the reality of 
		a brutal civil war that goes on and on and on to this day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The sacrifices of war, Mr. 
		President, are 
		immeasurable. It was not impossible to see back then that we might 
		arrive at the place we’re at today. I said then that a war based 
		not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics would 
		lead to a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, 
		with undetermined consequences. I believed that an invasion of Iraq 
		without a clear rationale or strong international support would only 
		strengthen the recruitment arm of al-Qaeda and erode the good standing 
		and moral authority that took our country generations to build. There 
		were other experts and leaders and everyday Americans who believed 
		this too.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I wish I had been wrong. I 
		wish we weren’t here talking about this at the beginning of the war’s 
		fifth year -- because the consequences of this war have been profound. And 
		the sacrifices have been immeasurable.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, those who would have us 
		continue this war in perpetuity like to say that this is a matter of 
		resolve on behalf of the American people. But the American people have 
		been extraordinarily resolved. They've seen their sons and daughters 
		killed and wounded on the streets of Fallujah. They've spent hundreds 
		of billions of dollars on this effort -- money that could have been 
		devoted to strengthening our homeland and our competitive 
		standing as a nation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is not a 
		failure of resolve that has led us into this chaos but a failed strategy 
		-- a strategy that has only strengthened Iran’s strategic 
		position, increased threats posed by terrorist organizations, reduced 
		U.S. credibility and influence around the world, and placed Israel and 
		other nations [friendly] to the United States in the region in greater 
		peril. Iraq has not been a failure 
		of resolve; it has been a failure of strategy -- and that strategy must 
		change. It is time to bring a responsible end to U.S. involvement in this conflict is now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's become apparent, Mr. 
		President, that there's no military 
		solution to this war. No amount of U.S. soldiers -- not 10,000 more, not 
		20,000 more, not almost 30,000 more than we know -- that we know we are sending 
		-- can solve the grievances that lay at the heart of someone else’s 
		civil war. Our troops cannot serve as their diplomats, and we can no 
		longer referee their civil war. We must begin a phased withdrawal of our 
		forces starting May 1st, with the goal of removing all combat forces by 
		March 30th, 2008.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also must make sure that 
		we’re not as careless getting out of this war as we were getting in, and 
		that’s why this withdrawal should be gradual, and maintain some U.S. troops 
		in the region to prevent a wider war in the region, while they can also 
		work on going after Al Qaeda and other 
		terrorists. But this phased withdrawal, Mr. President, must begin soon. 
		Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, 
		best hope to pressure the Iraqis to take ownership of their country and 
		bring an end to their conflict. It is time for our troops to start 
		coming home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">History will not judge, 
		Mr. President, the 
		architects of this war kindly. But the books have yet to be written on 
		our effort to right the wrongs we see in Iraq. The story has yet to be 
		told about how we turned from this moment, found our way out of the 
		desert, and took to heart the lessons of war that too many refused to 
		heed back then; for it is of little use or 
		comfort to recall past advice and warnings if we do not allow them to 
		guide us in the challenges that lie ahead. Mr. President, threats loom large in an age 
		where terrorist networks thrive, and there will certainly be times when 
		we have to call on our brave servicemen and women to risk their lives 
		again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But before we make that most 
		profound of all decisions, before we send our best off to battle, we 
		must remember what led us to this day and learn from the principles that 
		follow.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We must remember that 
		ideology is not a foreign policy. We must not embark on a war based on 
		untested theories, political agendas, or wishful thinking that has basis 
		-- that has little 
		basis in fact or reality. We must focus our efforts on the threats we 
		know exist, and we must evaluate those threats with sound intelligence 
		that is never manipulated for political reasons.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, we must remember that the 
		cost of going it alone is immense. It is a choice we sometimes have to 
		make, but one [that] must be made rarely and always reluctantly. That's 
		because America’s standing in the world is a precious resource not 
		easily rebuilt. We value the cooperation and goodwill of other nations 
		not because it makes us feel good, but because it makes all the world 
		safer; because the only way to battle 21st century threats that race 
		across the borders -- threats like terror and disease and nuclear 
		proliferation -- is to enlist the resources and support of all nations. 
		To win our wider struggle, we must let people across this planet know 
		that there is another, more hopeful alternative to the hateful 
		ideologies the terrorists espouse -- and renewed -- and a renewed America will reflect 
		and champion that vision.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, we must remember that 
		planning for peace is just as critical as planning for war. Iraq was not 
		just a failure of conception but a failure of execution, and so when a 
		conflict does arise that requires our involvement, we must understand that country’s history, its politics, its ethnic and 
		religious divisions before our troops ever set foot on its soil.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We must understand that 
		setting up ballot boxes does not a democracy make -- that real freedom 
		and real stability come from doing the hard work of helping to build a 
		strong police force, and a legitimate government, and ensuring that 
		people have food, and water, and electricity, and basic services. And we 
		must be honest about how much of that we can do ourselves and how much 
		must come from the people themselves.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, Mr. President, we must remember that when we send our servicemen and women to 
		war, we make sure we give them the training they need, and the 
		equipment that will keep them safe, and a mission that they can accomplish.
		We must respect our commanders’ advice not just when its politically 
		convenient, but even when it’s not what we want to hear. And when our 
		troops come home, it is our most solemn responsibility to make sure they 
		come home to the services, and the benefits, and the care they deserve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we stand at the beginning 
		of the fifth year of this war, Mr. President, let us remember -- let us 
		remember that young man from 
		Illinois, and his wife, and his daughters, and the thousands upon 
		thousands of families who are living the very real consequences and 
		immeasurable sacrifices that have come from our decision to invade Iraq. We are so blessed in this 
		country to have so many men and women like this -- Americans willing to 
		put on that uniform, and say the hard goodbyes, and risk their lives in 
		a far off land because they know that such consequences and sacrifices 
		are sometimes necessary to defend our country and achieve a lasting 
		peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is why we have no 
		greater responsibility than to ensure the decision to place them in 
		harm’s way is the right one. And that is why we must learn the lessons 
		of Iraq. It is what we owe our soldiers. It is what we owe their 
		families. And it is what we owe our country -- now, and all the days 
		and months to come.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, Mr. President. 
		I yield the floor.</font></p>
