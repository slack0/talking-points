transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FF0000">
			*</font>Thank you to the citizens of Berlin and<font color="#FF0000">*</font> -- and thank you to the 
			people of Germany. Let me thank Chancellor Merkel and Foreign 
			Minister Steinmeier for welcoming me earlier today. Thank you Mayor 
			Wowereit, the Berlin Senate, the police, and most of all thanks to 
			all of you 
			for this extraordinary welcome. Thank you.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I come to Berlin as so many of my countrymen have 
			come before; although tonight, I speak to you not as a candidate for 
			President, but as a citizen -- a proud citizen of the United States, 
			and a fellow citizen of the world.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that I don’t look like the Americans who’ve 
			previously spoken in this great city. The journey that led me here 
			is improbable. My mother was born in the heartland of America, but 
			my father grew up herding goats in Kenya. His father -- His father 
			-- my 
			grandfather -- was a cook, a domestic servant to the British.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the height of the Cold War, my father decided, 
			like so many others in the forgotten corners of the world, that his 
			yearning -- his dream -- required the freedom and opportunity promised 
			by the West. And so he wrote letter after letter to universities all 
			across America until somebody, somewhere answered his prayer for a 
			better life.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is why I am here. And you are here because you 
			too know that yearning. This city, of all cities, knows the dream of 
			freedom. And you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is 
			because men and women from both of our nations came together to 
			work, and struggle, and sacrifice for that better life.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ours is a partnership 
			that truly began 60 years 
			ago this summer, on the day when the first American plane touched 
			down at 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempelhof_International_Airport">
			<font color="#0000FF">Tempelhof</font></a>. On that day -- On that 
			day much of this continent still lay in 
			ruin.&nbsp; The rubble of this city had yet to be built into a wall. The 
			Soviet shadow had swept across Eastern Europe, while in the West, 
			America, Britain, and France took their stock of their losses, and 
			pondered how the world might be remade.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is where the two sides met.&nbsp;And on the 
			twenty-fourth of June, 1948, the Communists chose to blockade the 
			western part of the city.&nbsp;They cut off food and supplies to 
			more than two million Germans in an effort to extinguish the last 
			flame of freedom in Berlin.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The size of our forces was no match for the  
			larger Soviet Army. And yet retreat would have allowed Communism to 
			march across Europe. Where the last war had ended, another World War 
			could have easily begun. And all that stood in the way was Berlin. And that’s when 
			-- that's when the airlift began, when the largest 
			and most unlikely rescue in the history brought food and hope to the 
			people of this city.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The odds were stacked 
			against success. In the winter, a heavy fog filled the sky above, 
			and many planes were forced to turn back without dropping off the 
			needed supplies. The streets where we stand were filled with hungry 
			families who had no comfort from the cold.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But in the darkest hours, the people of Berlin kept 
			the flame of hope burning. The people of Berlin refused to give up. 
			And on one fall day, hundreds of thousands of Berliners came here, 
			to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiergarten">
			<font color="#0000FF">Tiergarten</font></a>, and heard the city’s mayor implore the world not 
			to give up on freedom. “There is only one possibility,” he said.&nbsp;“For us to stand together united until this battle is won…The people 
			of Berlin have spoken. We have done our duty,&quot; he said, &quot;and we will keep on 
			doing our duty. People of the world, now do your duty. People of the 
			world, look at Berlin.”</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">People of the world -- look at Berlin!</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Look at Berlin, where Germans and Americans learned 
			to work together and trust each other less than three years after 
			facing each other on the field of battle.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Look at Berlin, where 
			the determination of a people met the generosity of the
			<a href="georgecmarshall.html"><font color="#0000FF">Marshall Plan</font></a> 
			and created a German miracle; where a -- where a victory over 
			tyranny gave rise to NATO, the greatest alliance ever formed to 
			defend our common security.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Look at Berlin, where 
			the bullet holes in the buildings and the somber stones and pillars 
			near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate">
			<font color="#0000FF">Brandenburg Gate</font></a> insist that we 
			never forget our common humanity.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">People of the world -- look at Berlin, where 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall#The_Fall.2C_1989">
			<font color="#0000FF">a wall 
			came down</font></a>, a continent came together, and history proved that there 
			is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sixty years after the airlift, we are called upon 
			again. History has led us to a new crossroad, with new promise and 
			new peril. When you, the German people, tore down that wall -- a wall 
			that divided East and West; freedom and tyranny; fear and hope -- 
			walls came tumbling down around the world. From Kiev to Cape Town, 
			prison camps were closed, and the doors of democracy were opened. 
			Markets opened too, and the spread of information and technology 
			reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity. While the 20th 
			century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st century has 
			revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The fall of the Berlin Wall brought new hope. But 
			that very closeness has given rise to new dangers -- dangers that 
			cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the 
			distance of an ocean.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Think about it: The terrorists of September 11th plotted in Hamburg 
			and trained in Kandahar and Karachi before killing thousands from 
			all over the globe on American soil. As we speak, cars in Boston and factories in Beijing 
			are melting the ice caps in the Arctic, shrinking coastlines in the 
			Atlantic, and bringing drought to farms from Kansas to Kenya.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Poorly secured nuclear material in the former Soviet 
			Union, or secrets from a scientist in Pakistan could help build a 
			bomb that detonates in Paris. The poppies in Afghanistan come to 
			Berlin in the form of the 
			heroin. The poverty and violence in Somalia breeds the 
			terror of tomorrow. The <a href="georgeclooneyunitednations.htm">
			<font color="#0000FF">genocide in Darfur</font></a> shames the conscience of 
			us all.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this new world, such dangerous currents have 
			swept along faster than our efforts to contain them. And that is why we 
			cannot afford to be divided. No one nation, no matter how large or 
			powerful, can defeat such challenges alone.&nbsp;None of us can deny 
			these threats, or escape responsi[bility] in meeting them. In the 
			absence of Soviet tanks and a terrible wall, it has become easy to 
			forget this truth. And if we’re honest with each other, we know that 
			sometimes, on both sides of the Atlantic, we have drifted apart, and 
			forgotten our shared destiny.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Europe, the view that America is part of what has 
			gone wrong in our world, rather than a force to help us make it right, 
			has become all too common. In America, there are voices that deride 
			and deny the importance of Europe’s role in our security and our 
			future. Both views miss the truth: that Europeans today are bearing 
			new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the 
			world; and that just as American bases built in the last century 
			still help to defend the security of this continent, so does our 
			country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, there have been differences between America and 
			Europe. No doubt, there will be differences in the future. But the 
			burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together. A change 
			of leadership in Washington will not lift this burden. In this new 
			century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more 
			-- 
			not less. Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice; 
			it is the only way, the one way, to protect our common security and 
			advance our common humanity.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is why the greatest danger of all is to allow 
			new walls to divide us from one another. The walls between old allies on either side of the 
			Atlantic cannot stand. The walls between the countries with the 
			most and those with the least cannot stand.&nbsp;The walls between races 
			and tribes; natives and immigrants; Christians and Muslims and Jews 
			cannot stand.&nbsp;These now are the walls we must tear down.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know -- We know 
			that these walls have fallen before. After centuries of 
			strife, the people of Europe have formed a 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union">
			<font color="#0000FF">Union</font></a> of promise and 
			prosperity. Here, at the base of a 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Victory_Column">
			<font color="#0000FF">column built to mark victory in 
			war</font></a>, we meet in the center of a Europe at peace. Not only have walls 
			come down in Berlin, but they've come down in Belfast, where 
			Protestant and Catholic found a way to live together; in the 
			Balkans, where our Atlantic alliance ended wars and brought savage 
			war criminals to justice; and in South Africa, where the struggle of 
			a courageous people defeated apartheid.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So history reminds us that walls can be torn down. 
			But the task is never easy. True partnership and true progress 
			requires constant work and sustained sacrifice.&nbsp;They require 
			sharing the burdens of development and diplomacy; of peace and progress. 
			They require allies who will listen to each other, learn from each 
			other and, most of all, trust each other.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is why America cannot turn inward.&nbsp;That is why 
			Europe cannot turn inward. America has no better partner than 
			Europe. Now -- Now is the time to build new bridges across the globe as 
			strong as the one that binds us across the Atlantic.&nbsp;Now is the 
			time to join together, through constant cooperation and strong 
			institutions and shared sacrifice and a global commitment to progress, 
			to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It was this spirit that 
			led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads, and people 
			to assemble where we stand today.&nbsp;And this is the moment when our 
			nations -- and all nations -- must summon that spirit anew.</font></p>
			<p align="left">
			<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the moment when we must defeat terror and 
			dry up the well of extremism that supports it.&nbsp;This threat is real 
			and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it. If we 
			could create NATO to face down the Soviet Union, we can join in a 
			new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have 
			struck in Madrid and Amman; in London and Bali; in Washington and 
			New York.&nbsp;If we could win a battle of ideas against the communists, 
			we can stand with the vast majority of Muslims who reject the 
			extremism that leads to hate instead of hope.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the moment when we must renew our resolve to 
			rout the terrorists who threaten our security in Afghanistan, and 
			the traffickers who sell drugs on your streets.&nbsp;No one welcomes 
			war. I recognize the enormous difficulties in Afghanistan.&nbsp;But my 
			country and yours have a stake in seeing that NATO’s first mission 
			beyond Europe’s borders is a success. For the people of Afghanistan, 
			and for our shared security, the work must be done.&nbsp;America can't 
			do this alone.&nbsp; The Afghan people need our troops and your troops; 
			our support and your support to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda, to 
			develop their economy, and to help them rebuild their nation.&nbsp;We 
			have too much at stake to turn back now.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This -- This is the 
			moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear 
			weapons.&nbsp; The two superpowers that faced each other across the 
			wall of this city came too close too often to destroying all we have 
			built and all that we love. With that wall gone, we need not stand 
			idly by and watch the further spread of the deadly atom. It is time 
			to secure all loose nuclear materials; to stop the spread of nuclear 
			weapons; and to reduce the arsenals from another era. This is the 
			moment to begin the work of seeking the peace of a world without 
			nuclear weapons.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the moment when every nation in Europe must 
			have the chance to choose its own tomorrow, free from the shadows of 
			yesterday.&nbsp;In this century, we need a strong European Union that 
			deepens the security and prosperity of this continent, while 
			extending a hand abroad.&nbsp;In this century -- in this city of all 
			cities -- we must reject the Cold War mind-set of the past, and 
			resolve to work with Russia when we can, to stand up for our values 
			when we must, and to seek a partnership that extends across this 
			entire continent.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the moment when we must build on the wealth 
			that opens [sic] markets have created, and share its benefits more 
			equitably.&nbsp;Trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global 
			development.&nbsp;But we will not be able to sustain this growth if it 
			favors the few, and not the many.&nbsp;Together -- Together we must forge trade 
			that truly rewards the work that creates wealth, with meaningful 
			protections for our people and our planet.&nbsp;This is the moment for 
			trade that is free and fair for all.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the moment we must help answer the call for 
			a new dawn in the Middle East. My country must stand with yours and 
			with Europe in sending a direct message to Iran that it must abandon 
			its nuclear ambitions. We must support the Lebanese who've marched 
			and bled for democracy, and the Israelis and the Palestinians who seek a 
			secure and lasting peace. And despite -- despite past differences, this is the 
			moment when the world should support the millions of Iraqis who seek 
			to rebuild their lives, even as we pass responsibility to the Iraqi 
			government and finally bring this war to a close.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This -- This is the moment when we must come together to 
			save this planet.&nbsp;Let us resolve that we will not leave our 
			children to a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and 
			terrible storms devastate our lands.&nbsp;Let us resolve that all 
			nations -- including my own -- will act with the same seriousness of 
			purpose as has your nation, and reduce the carbon we send into our 
			atmosphere.&nbsp;This -- This is the moment to give our children back their 
			future. This is the moment to stand as one.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is the moment 
			when we must give hope to those left behind in a globalized world. 
			We must remember that the Cold War born in this city was not a 
			battle for land or treasure. Sixty years ago, the planes that flew 
			over Berlin did not drop bombs; instead they delivered food, and 
			coal, and candy to grateful children. And in that show of 
			solidarity, those pilots won more than a military victory. They won 
			hearts and minds; love and loyalty and trust -- not just from the 
			people in this city, but from all those who heard the story of what 
			they did here.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now the world will 
			watch and remember what we do here -- what we do with this moment. 
			Will we extend our hand to the people in the forgotten corners of 
			this world who yearn for lives marked by dignity and opportunity, by 
			security and justice? Will we lift the child in Bangladesh from 
			poverty, and shelter the refugee in Chad, and banish the scourge of 
			AIDS in our time?</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Will we stand for the 
			human rights of the dissident in Burma, the blogger in Iran, or the 
			voter in Zimbabwe? Will we give meaning to the words “never again” 
			in Darfur?</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Will we acknowledge -- 
			Will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful 
			example than the one each of our nations projects to the world?&nbsp;Will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law? Will we 
			-- Will we -- Will we welcome immigrants from different lands, and shun discrimination 
			against those who don’t look like us or worship like we do, and keep 
			the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people?</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">People of Berlin -- people of the world 
			-- this is our 
			moment.&nbsp;This is our time.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I know my country has 
			not perfected itself. At times, we’ve struggled to keep the promise 
			of liberty and equality for all of our people. We’ve made our share 
			of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world 
			have not lived up to our best intentions.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But I also know how much I love America. I know that 
			for more than two centuries, we have strived -- at great cost and 
			great sacrifice -- to form <a href="barackobamaperfectunion.htm">
			<font color="#0000FF">a more perfect union</font></a>; to seek, with other 
			nations, a more hopeful world.&nbsp;Our allegiance has never been to any 
			particular tribe or kingdom -- indeed, every language is spoken in 
			our country; every culture has left its imprint on ours; every point 
			of view is expressed in our public squares. What has always united 
			us, what has always driven our people, what drew my father to 
			America’s shores -- is a set of ideals that speak to aspirations 
			shared by all people: that we can live free from fear and free from 
			want; that we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we 
			choose and worship as we please.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These are the aspiration[s] that join the fates of 
			all nations in this city. These aspirations are bigger than anything 
			that drives us apart. It is because of these aspirations that the 
			airlift began. It is because of these aspirations that 
			<a href="jfkichbineinberliner.html"><font color="#0000FF">all free 
			people -- everywhere -- became citizens of Berlin</font></a>. It is in pursuit of 
			these aspirations that a new generation -- our generation -- must make 
			our mark on the world.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">People of Berlin -- and people of the world 
			-- the 
			scale of our challenge is great.&nbsp;The road ahead will be long. But I 
			come before you to say that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom. 
			We are a people of improbable hope.&nbsp;With an eye toward the future, 
			with resolve in our heart, let us remember this history, and answer 
			our destiny, and remake the world once again.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, Berlin. God 
			bless you. Thank you. Thank you. </font> </p> </div>
