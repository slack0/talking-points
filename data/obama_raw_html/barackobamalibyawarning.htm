			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good afternoon, 
			everybody.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I want to take this opportunity to update the American 
			people about the situation in Libya.&nbsp; Over the last several weeks, 
			the world has watched events unfold in Libya with hope and alarm.&nbsp; 
			Last month, protesters took to the streets across the country to 
			demand their universal rights, and a government that is accountable 
			to them and responsive to their aspirations.&nbsp; But they were met with 
			an iron fist.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Within days, whole parts 
			of the country declared their independence from a brutal regime, and 
			members of the government serving in Libya and abroad chose to align 
			themselves with the forces of change.&nbsp; Moammar Qaddafi clearly lost 
			the confidence of his own people and the legitimacy to lead.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Instead of respecting 
			the rights of his own people, Qaddafi chose the path of brutal 
			suppression.&nbsp; Innocent civilians were beaten, imprisoned, and in 
			some cases killed.&nbsp; Peaceful protests were forcefully put down.&nbsp; 
			Hospitals were attacked and patients disappeared.&nbsp; A campaign of 
			intimidation and repression began.</font></p>
		
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the face of this 
			injustice, the United States and the international community moved 
			swiftly.&nbsp; Sanctions were put in place by the United States and our 
			allies and partners.&nbsp; The U.N. Security Council imposed further 
			sanctions, an arms embargo, and the specter of international 
			accountability for Qaddafi and those around him.&nbsp; Humanitarian 
			assistance was positioned on Libya’s borders, and those displaced by 
			the violence received our help.&nbsp; Ample warning was given that 
			Qaddafi needed to stop his campaign of repression, or be held 
			accountable.&nbsp; The Arab League and the European Union joined us in 
			calling for an end to violence.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once again, Qaddafi 
			chose to ignore the will of his people and the international 
			community.&nbsp; Instead, he launched a military campaign against his own 
			people.&nbsp; And there should be no doubt about his intentions, because 
			he himself has made them clear.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For decades, he has 
			demonstrated a willingness to use brute force through his 
			sponsorship of terrorism against the American people as well as 
			others, and through the killings that he has carried out within his 
			own borders.&nbsp; And just yesterday, speaking of the city of Benghazi 
			-- a city of roughly 700,000 people -- he threatened, and I quote: 
			“We will have no mercy and no pity” -- no mercy on his own citizens.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, here is why this 
			matters to us.&nbsp; Left unchecked, we have every reason to believe that 
			Qaddafi would commit atrocities against his people.&nbsp; Many thousands 
			could die.&nbsp; A humanitarian crisis would ensue.&nbsp; The entire region 
			could be destabilized, endangering many of our allies and partners.&nbsp; 
			The calls of the Libyan people for help would go unanswered.&nbsp; The 
			democratic values that we stand for would be overrun.&nbsp; Moreover, the 
			words of the international community would be rendered hollow.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that’s why the 
			United States has worked with our allies and partners to shape a 
			strong international response at the United Nations.&nbsp; Our focus has 
			been clear: protecting innocent civilians within Libya, and holding 
			the Qaddafi regime accountable.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yesterday, in response 
			to a call for action by the Libyan people and the Arab League, the 
			U.N. Security Council passed a strong resolution that demands an end 
			to the violence against citizens.&nbsp; It authorizes the use of force 
			with an explicit commitment to pursue all necessary measures to stop 
			the killing, to include the enforcement of a no-fly zone over 
			Libya.&nbsp; It also strengthens our sanctions and the enforcement of an 
			arms embargo against the Qaddafi regime.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, once more, Moammar 
			Qaddafi has a choice.&nbsp; The resolution that passed lays out very 
			clear conditions that must be met.&nbsp; The United States, the United 
			Kingdom, France, and Arab states agree that a cease-fire must be 
			implemented immediately.&nbsp; That means all attacks against civilians 
			must stop.&nbsp; Qaddafi must stop his troops from advancing on Benghazi, 
			pull them back from Ajdabiya, Misrata, and Zawiya, and establish 
			water, electricity and gas supplies to all areas.&nbsp; Humanitarian 
			assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let me be clear, these 
			terms are not negotiable.&nbsp; These terms are not subject to 
			negotiation.&nbsp; If Qaddafi does not comply with the resolution, the 
			international community will impose consequences, and the resolution 
			will be enforced through military action.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In this effort, the 
			United States is prepared to act as part of an international 
			coalition.&nbsp; American leadership is essential, but that does not mean 
			acting alone -– it means shaping the conditions for the 
			international community to act together.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s why I have 
			directed Secretary Gates and our military to coordinate their 
			planning, and tomorrow Secretary Clinton will travel to Paris for a 
			meeting with our European allies and Arab partners about the 
			enforcement of Resolution 1973.&nbsp; We will provide the unique 
			capabilities that we can bring to bear to stop the violence against 
			civilians, including enabling our European allies and Arab partners 
			to effectively enforce a no fly zone.&nbsp; I have no doubt that the men 
			and women of our military are capable of carrying out this mission.&nbsp; 
			Once more, they have the thanks of a grateful nation and the 
			admiration of the world.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I also want to be clear 
			about what we will not be doing. The United States is not going to 
			deploy ground troops into Libya.&nbsp; And we are not going to use force 
			to go beyond a well-defined goal --- specifically, the protection of 
			civilians in Libya.&nbsp; In the coming weeks, we will continue to help 
			the Libyan people with humanitarian and economic assistance so that 
			they can fulfill their aspirations peacefully.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, the United States 
			did not seek this outcome.&nbsp; Our decisions have been driven by 
			Qaddafi’s refusal to respect the rights of his people, and the 
			potential for mass murder of innocent civilians.&nbsp; It is not an 
			action that we will pursue alone.&nbsp; Indeed, our British and French 
			allies, and members of the Arab League, have already committed to 
			take a leadership role in the enforcement of this resolution, just 
			as they were instrumental in pursuing it.&nbsp; We are coordinating 
			closely with them.&nbsp; And this is precisely how the international 
			community should work, as more nations bear both the responsibility 
			and the cost of enforcing international law.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is just one more 
			chapter in the change that is unfolding across the Middle East and 
			North Africa.&nbsp; From the beginning of these protests, we have made it 
			clear that we are opposed to violence.&nbsp; We have made clear our 
			support for a set of universal values, and our support for the 
			political and economic change that the people of the region 
			deserve.&nbsp; But I want to be clear:&nbsp; the change in the region will not 
			and cannot be imposed by the United States or any foreign power; 
			ultimately, it will be driven by the people of the Arab World.&nbsp; It 
			is their right and their responsibility to determine their own 
			destiny.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let me close by saying 
			that there is no decision I face as your Commander in Chief that I 
			consider as carefully as the decision to ask our men and women to 
			use military force.&nbsp; Particularly at a time when our military is 
			fighting in Afghanistan and winding down our activities in Iraq, 
			that decision is only made more difficult.&nbsp; But the United States of 
			America will not stand idly by in the face of actions that undermine 
			global peace and security.&nbsp; So I have taken this decision with the 
			confidence that action is necessary, and that we will not be acting 
			alone.&nbsp; Our goal is focused, our cause is just, and our coalition is 
			strong.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you very much.</font></p>
