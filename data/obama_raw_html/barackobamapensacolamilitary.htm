<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you! Well, hello, Pensacola!&nbsp; It 
		is great to be here.&nbsp; I want everybody, first of all, to give a big 
		round of applause to Chief Elison Talabong for leading us in the pledge 
		and singing our National Anthem -- to Lieutenant Commander Randy Ekstrom 
		for the wonderful invocation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank your 
		outstanding local leaders for welcoming me here today, including 
		Captains Chris Plummer, Mike Price and Brad Martin.&nbsp; Give them a big 
		round of applause.&nbsp; And your great senior enlisted leaders, including 
		Master Chief Mike Dollen, give them a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank all the 
		spouses and families who are joining us here today.&nbsp; You hold our 
		military families together, so we honor your service as well.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is great to be here in 
		Pensacola -- America’s oldest naval air station, “the cradle of naval 
		aviation.”&nbsp; We’ve got Navy -- all the students of the Naval Air 
		Technical Training Center.&nbsp; We’ve got Training Wing Six, 
		maybe a few Blue Angels.&nbsp; We’ve got the United States Marines in the 
		house -- maybe a few Air Force and Army, too.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I don’t know how many 
		could be here, because they’re out there on the water right now, 
		responding to the spill -- but I want to thank all the folks at Coast 
		Guard Station Pensacola for their outstanding work.&nbsp; And I know somebody 
		who is especially proud of them, and that’s the former Commandant of the 
		Coast Guard who postponed his retirement to answer his country’s call 
		once more and coordinate the federal response effort to the spill -- and 
		that’s Admiral Thad Allen.&nbsp; Please give him a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I was just down at the 
		Pensacola Beach Gulf Pier, at the Fish Sandwich Snack Bar.&nbsp; Now, I don’t 
		know if any of you ever checked it out.&nbsp; It’s a nice spot.&nbsp; We were 
		there with some of Florida’s state and local leaders to discuss the 
		situation here.&nbsp; I want to acknowledge the hard work that’s being done 
		by the governor of Florida, Charlie Crist; Florida’s Chief Financial 
		Officer, Alex Sink; Senators Bill Nelson, George LeMieux, 
		representatives who are here today -- we got Jeff Miller and Corrine 
		Brown and Ted Deutch.&nbsp; Please give them a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ve got Escambia County 
		Commissioner Grover Robinson and Pensacola Mayor Mike Wiggins.&nbsp; Thank 
		you very much for your outstanding efforts.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know all of you join me in 
		thanking these leaders and their communities -- because they’re your 
		neighbors -- for the incredible support that they give all the men and 
		women and your families here in Pensacola.&nbsp; So we’re grateful to you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But this is my fourth visit 
		to the Gulf Coast since the start of this spill.&nbsp; Yesterday, I was over 
		in Gulfport, Mississippi; Theodore, Alabama; and now Pensacola -- 
		assessing the situation, reviewing the response, seeing what needs to be 
		done better and faster, and talking with folks -- whether fishermen or 
		small business people and their families -- who are seeing their lives 
		turned upside-down by this disaster.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here in Pensacola, the 
		beautiful beaches are still open.&nbsp; The sand is white and the water is 
		blue.&nbsp; So folks who are looking for a good vacation, they can still come 
		down to Pensacola.&nbsp; People need to know that Pensacola is still open for 
		business.&nbsp; But that doesn’t mean that people aren’t angry.&nbsp; That doesn’t 
		mean that people aren’t scared.&nbsp; That doesn’t mean that people have 
		concerns about the future -- we all have those concerns.&nbsp; And people 
		have every right to be angry.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those plumes of oil are off 
		the coast.&nbsp; The fishing waters are closed.&nbsp; Tar balls have been coming 
		ashore.&nbsp; And everybody is bracing for more.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I’ll say today what I’ve 
		been saying up and down the Coast over the last couple of days and over 
		the last month.&nbsp; Yes, this is an unprecedented environmental disaster -- 
		it’s the worst in our nation’s history.&nbsp; But we’re going to continue to 
		meet it with an unprecedented federal response and recovery effort -- 
		the largest in our nation’s history.&nbsp; This is an assault on our shores, 
		and we’re going to fight back with everything we’ve got.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that includes mobilizing 
		the resources of the greatest military in the world.&nbsp; Here at Naval Air 
		Station Pensacola, you’ve been one of the major staging areas.&nbsp; You’ve 
		helped to support the response effort.&nbsp; And I thank you for that, and I 
		know the people of Pensacola thank you for that.&nbsp; And all along the Gulf 
		coast, our men and women in uniform -- active, Guard, and Reserve -- 
		from across the country are stepping up and helping out.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They’re soldiers on the 
		beaches putting out sandbags and building barriers and cleaning up the 
		oil, and helping people process their claims for compensation from BP.&nbsp; 
		They’re sailors and Marines offering their ships and their skimmers and 
		their helicopters and miles of boom.&nbsp; They’re airmen overhead, flying in 
		equipment and spraying dispersant.&nbsp; And, of course, there are Coast 
		Guardsmen and women on the cutters, in the air, working around the 
		clock.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And when I say this is the 
		largest response of its kind in American history, I mean it.&nbsp; We’ve got 
		more than 5,000 vessels on site -- skimmers, tugs, barges, dozens of 
		aircraft.&nbsp; More than 27,000 personnel are on the scene, fighting this 
		every day, putting out millions of feet of boom and cleaning the shores.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All told, we’ve authorized 
		the deployment of 17,500 National Guardsmen to respond to this crisis.&nbsp; 
		So far, only about 1,600 have been activated.&nbsp; That leaves a lot of 
		Guardsmen ready to help.&nbsp; And if our governors call on them, I know 
		they’ll be ready, because they’re always ready.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I want the people of this 
		region to know that my administration is going to do whatever it takes, 
		for as long as it takes, to deal with this disaster.&nbsp; That includes the 
		additional actions I announced yesterday to make sure that seafood from 
		the Gulf is safe to eat.&nbsp; It includes steps we’ve taken to protect the 
		safety of workers involved in the cleanup.&nbsp; It includes the new command 
		structure I announced this morning to make sure states and local 
		communities like Pensacola have the autonomy and the resources that they 
		need to go forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that includes 
		something else -- making sure BP pays for the damages that it has caused -- because this isn’t just an environmental disaster.&nbsp; For 
		many families and communities, it’s an economic disaster.&nbsp; Here in 
		Pensacola and the Panhandle, tourism is everything.&nbsp; And when the 
		tourists stay home, it ripples out and hits folks across these 
		communities -- the charter boats, the hotels, the restaurants, the 
		roadside stores, the shops, the suppliers, the dive shops.&nbsp; And if your 
		inland waters are contaminated -- if the bays and bayous are 
		contaminated -- it could be devastating, changing the way of life down 
		here for years to come.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’m going to speak to the 
		nation tonight about this.&nbsp; But let me say to the people of Pensacola 
		and the Gulf Coast:&nbsp; I am with you, my administration is with you for 
		the long haul to make sure BP pays for the damage that it has done and 
		to make sure that you are getting the help you need to protect this 
		beautiful coast and to rehabilitate the damaged areas, to revitalize 
		this region, and to make sure that nothing like this happens ever 
		again.&nbsp; That is a commitment I am making to the people of Florida and 
		people all across this Gulf.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, that spirit -- that 
		spirit of resolve and determination and resilience, that’s the same 
		spirit we see in all of you, the men and women in uniform, the spirit 
		we’ll need to meet other challenges of our time.&nbsp; Obviously the news has 
		been dominated lately by the oil spill, but our nation is at war and all 
		of you have stepped forward.&nbsp; You volunteered.&nbsp; You took an oath.&nbsp; You 
		stood tall and you said, “I will serve.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And here at Pensacola, 
		you’re carrying on the proud tradition of naval aviation that spans a 
		century.&nbsp; Here at the Barrancas National Cemetery, our heroes from 
		yesterday’s wars are still inspiring us.&nbsp; And like generations before 
		you, you’re no strangers to sacrifice.&nbsp; Our prayers are with the 
		families and friends of the crews that you lost in that training 
		exercise two months ago.&nbsp; Today, we send out our thoughts and prayers to 
		all the folks from Pensacola on the frontlines at this very moment, 
		including Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; They are making us incredibly proud.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so are you.&nbsp; As naval 
		aviators and naval flight officers, you’ll soon earn your “Wings of 
		Gold.”&nbsp; Many of you will prove yourselves as indispensable air crews -- 
		the mechanics, the engineers, the electricians, the maintenance crews -- 
		people’s lives depending on what you do each and every day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know you’re looking ahead 
		to your first operational tours -- to join the fleet and your 
		squadrons.&nbsp; And within weeks, some of you may find yourselves serving on 
		a carrier deck in the Arabian Sea or working a busy flight line in 
		Afghanistan.&nbsp; And as you begin your careers, as you look ahead to a life 
		of service, I want you to know -- on behalf of the American people -- 
		that your nation thanks you, your nation appreciates you, your nation 
		will stand with you every step of the way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as your 
		Commander-in-Chief, I want you to know something:&nbsp; I will not hesitate 
		to use force to protect the American people or our vital interests.&nbsp; But 
		I will also never risk your lives unless it’s absolutely necessary.&nbsp; And 
		if it is necessary, we are going to back you up to the hilt with the 
		strategy and the clear mission and the equipment and the support that 
		you need to get the job done right.&nbsp; That’s my promise to every one of 
		you, every man and woman who wears America’s uniform.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That includes the right 
		strategy in Iraq, where we’re partnering with the Iraqi people for their 
		long-term security and prosperity.&nbsp; And thanks to the honor and the 
		heroism of our troops, we are poised to end our combat mission in Iraq 
		this summer -- on schedule.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we end the war in Iraq, 
		we’re pressing forward in Afghanistan.&nbsp; We’re working to break the 
		momentum of the Taliban insurgency and train Afghan security forces, 
		strengthen the capacity of the Afghan government and protect the Afghan 
		people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will disrupt and 
		dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates.&nbsp; 
		And we will support the aspirations of people around the 
		world as they seek progress and opportunity and prosperity, because 
		that’s what we do -- as Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As you meet the missions we 
		ask of you, we’re going to make sure you’re trained and equipped to 
		succeed.&nbsp; That’s why we halted reductions in the Navy.&nbsp; That’s why we 
		increased the size of the Marine Corps.&nbsp; That’s why we’re investing in 
		the capabilities and technologies of tomorrow.&nbsp; And as we come up on the 
		100th anniversary of naval aviation next year, we’re committed to the 
		next generation of aircraft.&nbsp; We’re going to keep you the best-trained, 
		best-led, best-equipped military that the world has ever known.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of that is about 
		technology.&nbsp; But the most important thing in our military is our people 
		-- it’s all of you.&nbsp; And as you advance through the ranks and start 
		families of your own, we want to be there for your loved ones, too.&nbsp; 
		This is one of the defining missions of the First Lady, Michelle Obama.&nbsp; 
		On Sunday, she visited the Navy-Marine Corps team and their families at 
		Camp Pendleton.&nbsp; And they had a tough week, because five outstanding 
		Marines from Pendleton gave their lives last week in Afghanistan.&nbsp; 
		During her visit, Michelle had a message for their families and for all 
		military families:&nbsp; America is going to keep faith with you, too.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When a loved one goes to 
		war, that family goes to war.&nbsp; That’s why we’re working to improve 
		family readiness and increase pay and benefits, working to give you more 
		time between deployments, increasing support to help spouses and 
		families deal with the stresses and the separation of war.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But this can’t be the work 
		of government alone.&nbsp; As Michelle has been saying, 1 percent of 
		Americans may be fighting our wars, but 100 percent of Americans need to 
		be supporting our men and women and their families in uniform.&nbsp; You guys 
		shouldn’t be carrying the entire burden.&nbsp; That’s why Michelle is 
		challenging every sector of American society to support our military 
		families -- not just now, with our nation at war, but at every stage of 
		your lives.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we’re improving care for 
		our wounded warriors, especially those with post-traumatic stress and 
		traumatic brain injury.&nbsp; We’re funding the Post-9/11 GI Bill -- to give 
		you and your families the chance to pursue your dreams.&nbsp; We’ve made a 
		historic commitment to our veterans with one of the largest percentage 
		increases to the VA budget in the past 30 years.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those are concrete actions 
		we’ve taken to meet the commitment I have to you and that the American 
		people have to you.&nbsp; Because you’ve always taken care of America, 
		America needs to take care of you.&nbsp; And that’s my main message here 
		today.&nbsp; We’re all in this together.&nbsp; In our country, there isn’t a 
		“military world” and a “civilian world.”&nbsp; We’re all Americans.&nbsp; There’s 
		not Democrats and Republicans, when you take the long view -- we’re all 
		Americans.&nbsp; We all rise and fall together.&nbsp; And we all need to do our 
		part to get through the challenges we face as a people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, yes, we’re emerging from 
		the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.&nbsp; Too many folks 
		are still out of work here in Florida and around the country.&nbsp; Yes, 
		we’re a nation at war with adversaries who will stop at nothing to 
		strike our homeland and would kill innocent people, women and children, 
		with no compunction.&nbsp; Yes, we’re now battling the worst economic -- 
		environmental disaster in American history.&nbsp; Any one of these challenges 
		alone would test our country.&nbsp; Confronting them all at once might 
		overwhelm a lesser nation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But look around you.&nbsp; Look 
		at the person standing next to you.&nbsp; You look around and you see the 
		strength and resilience that will carry us through.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You look at this 
		installation and the forts that have stood watch over this bay and its 
		people for centuries -- through the rise and fall of empires, through a 
		terrible Civil War -- and as a nation healed itself, we became a beacon 
		to the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ve endured.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of these men and women 
		in uniform, all of you represent the same spirit of service and 
		sacrifice as those who’ve gone before -- who defeated fascism, defeated 
		tyranny, prevailed in a long Cold War over communism.&nbsp; And now, in our 
		time, you’ve toppled regimes based on terror and dictatorship, and 
		you’ve given new hope to millions of people.&nbsp; You’ve earned your place 
		among the greatest of generations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And look at the people of 
		this city and this region -- fishermen who’ve made their lives on the 
		water, families who’ve lived here for generations, hardworking folks 
		who’ve had to endure more than their share -- tough economic times and 
		hurricanes and storms that forced so many families and communities to 
		start over from scratch.&nbsp; But they never gave up.&nbsp; They started over, 
		and they rebuilt stronger than before.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Americans, we don’t 
		quit.&nbsp; We keep coming.&nbsp; None of these challenges we’re facing are going 
		to be easy.&nbsp; None of them are going to be quick, but make no mistake, 
		the United States of America has gone through tough times before and we 
		always come out stronger.&nbsp; And we will do so again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this city and this 
		region will recover.&nbsp; It will thrive again.&nbsp; And America’s military will 
		prevail in the mission to keep our country safe.&nbsp; And our nation will 
		endure from these trials stronger than before.&nbsp; That is the history of 
		the United States of America.&nbsp; That is the legacy of our Armed Forces.&nbsp; 
		And I promise you that we will not falter.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Past generations have passed 
		on this precious gift to us, and future generations are depending on 
		us.&nbsp; And as I look out on each and every one of your faces, I’m 
		absolutely confident that you will meet that challenge.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">God bless you and God bless 
		the United States of America.</font></p>
