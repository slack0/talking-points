<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.&nbsp; 
		Everybody, please have a seat.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Well, thank you.&nbsp; 
		It is good to be back.&nbsp;It is good to be back in New York, it is good to 
		be back in the Great Hall at Cooper Union.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ve got some special 
		guests here that I want to acknowledge.&nbsp; Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney 
		is here in the house.&nbsp; Governor David Paterson is here.&nbsp; Attorney 
		General Andrew Cuomo.&nbsp; State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli is here.&nbsp; The 
		Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg.&nbsp; Dr. George Campbell, Jr., 
		president of Cooper Union.&nbsp;And all the citywide elected officials who 
		are here.&nbsp; Thank you very much for your attendance.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is wonderful to be back 
		in Cooper Union, where generations of leaders and citizens have come to 
		defend their ideas and contest their differences.&nbsp; It’s also good to be 
		back in Lower Manhattan, a few blocks from Wall Street.&nbsp; It really is 
		good to be back, because Wall Street is the heart of our nation’s 
		financial sector.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, since I last spoke here 
		two years ago, our country has been through a terrible trial.&nbsp; More than 
		8 million people have lost their jobs.&nbsp; Countless small businesses have 
		had to shut their doors.&nbsp; Trillions of dollars in savings have been lost 
		-- forcing seniors to put off retirement, young people to postpone 
		college, entrepreneurs to give up on the dream of starting a company.&nbsp; 
		And as a nation we were forced to take unprecedented steps to rescue the 
		financial system and the broader economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as a result of the 
		decisions we made -- some of which, let’s face it, were very unpopular 
		-- we are seeing hopeful signs.&nbsp; A little more than one year ago we were 
		losing an average of 750,000 jobs each month.&nbsp; Today, America is adding 
		jobs again.&nbsp; One year ago the economy was shrinking rapidly.&nbsp; Today the 
		economy is growing.&nbsp; In fact, we’ve seen the fastest turnaround in 
		growth in nearly three decades.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But you’re here and I’m here 
		because we’ve got more work to do.&nbsp; Until this progress is felt not just 
		on Wall Street but on Main Street we cannot be satisfied.&nbsp; Until the 
		millions of our neighbors who are looking for work can find a job, and 
		wages are growing at a meaningful pace, we may be able to claim a 
		technical recovery -- but we will not have truly recovered.&nbsp; And even as 
		we seek to revive this economy, it’s also incumbent on us to rebuild it 
		stronger than before.&nbsp; We don’t want an economy that has the same 
		weaknesses that led to this crisis.&nbsp; And that means addressing some of 
		the underlying problems that led to this turmoil and devastation in the 
		first place.<br>
		Now, one of the most significant contributors to this recession was a 
		financial crisis as dire as any we’ve known in generations -- at least 
		since the ’30s.&nbsp; And that crisis was born of a failure of responsibility 
		-- from Wall Street all the way to Washington -- that brought down many 
		of the world’s largest financial firms and nearly dragged our economy 
		into a second Great Depression.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was that failure of 
		responsibility that I spoke about when I came to New York more than two 
		years ago -- before the worst of the crisis had unfolded.&nbsp; It was back 
		in 2007.&nbsp; And I take no satisfaction in noting that my comments then 
		have largely been borne out by the events that followed.&nbsp; But I repeat 
		what I said then because it is essential that we learn the lessons from 
		this crisis so we don’t doom ourselves to repeat it.&nbsp; And make no 
		mistake, that is exactly what will happen if we allow this moment to 
		pass -- and that’s an outcome that is unacceptable to me and it’s 
		unacceptable to you, the American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As I said on this stage two 
		years ago, I believe in the power of the free market.&nbsp; I believe in a 
		strong financial sector that helps people to raise capital and get loans 
		and invest their savings.&nbsp; That’s part of what has made America what it 
		is.&nbsp; But a free market was never meant to be a free license to take 
		whatever you can get, however you can get it.&nbsp; That’s what happened too 
		often in the years leading up to this crisis.&nbsp; Some -- and let me be 
		clear, not all -- but some on Wall Street forgot that behind every 
		dollar traded or leveraged there’s family looking to buy a house, or pay 
		for an education, open a business, save for retirement.&nbsp; What happens on 
		Wall Street has real consequences across the country, across our 
		economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ve spoken before about the 
		need to build a new foundation for economic growth in the 21st century.&nbsp; 
		And given the importance of the financial sector, Wall Street reform is 
		an absolutely essential part of that foundation.&nbsp; Without it, our house 
		will continue to sit on shifting sands, and our families, businesses, 
		and the global economy will be vulnerable to future crises.&nbsp; That’s why 
		I feel so strongly that we need to enact a set of updated, commonsense 
		rules to ensure accountability on Wall Street and to protect consumers 
		in our financial system.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, here’s the good news:&nbsp; 
		A comprehensive plan to achieve these reforms has already passed the 
		House of Representatives.&nbsp; A Senate version is currently being debated, 
		drawing on ideas from Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp; Both bills represent 
		significant improvement on the flawed rules that we have in place today, 
		despite the furious effort of industry lobbyists to shape this 
		legislation to their special interests.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And for those of you in the 
		financial sector I'm sure that some of these lobbyists work for you and 
		they’re doing what they are being paid to do.&nbsp; But I’m here today 
		specifically -- when I speak to the titans of industry here -- because I 
		want to urge you to join us, instead of fighting us in this effort.&nbsp; I’m 
		here because I believe that these reforms are, in the end, not only in 
		the best interest of our country, but in the best interest of the 
		financial sector.&nbsp; And I’m here to explain what reform will look like, 
		and why it matters.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, first, the bill being 
		considered in the Senate would create what we did not have before, and 
		that is a way to protect the financial system and the broader economy 
		and American taxpayers in the event that a large financial firm begins 
		to fail.&nbsp; If there’s a Lehmans or an AIG, how can we respond in a way 
		that doesn’t force taxpayers to pick up the tab or, alternatively, could 
		bring down the whole system.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In an ordinary local bank 
		when it approaches insolvency, we’ve got a process, an orderly process 
		through the FDIC, that ensures that depositors are protected, maintains 
		confidence in the banking system, and it works.&nbsp; Customers and taxpayers 
		are protected and owners and management lose their equity.&nbsp; But we don’t 
		have that kind of process designed to contain the failure of a Lehman 
		Brothers or any of the largest and most interconnected financial firms 
		in our country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why, when this crisis 
		began, crucial decisions about what would happen to some of the world’s 
		biggest companies -- companies employing tens of thousands of people and 
		holding hundreds of billions of dollars in assets -- had to take place 
		in hurried discussions in the middle of the night.&nbsp; And that’s why, to 
		save the entire economy from an even worse catastrophe, we had to deploy 
		taxpayer dollars.&nbsp; Now, much of that money has now been paid back and my 
		administration has proposed a fee to be paid by large financial firms to 
		recover all the money, every dime, because the American people should 
		never have been put in that position in the first place.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But this is why we need a 
		system to shut these firms down with the least amount of collateral 
		damage to innocent people and innocent businesses.&nbsp; And from the start, 
		I’ve insisted that the financial industry, not taxpayers, shoulder the 
		costs in the event that a large financial company should falter.&nbsp; The 
		goal is to make certain that taxpayers are never again on the hook 
		because a firm is deemed “too big to fail.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there’s a legitimate 
		debate taking place about how best to ensure taxpayers are held harmless 
		in this process.&nbsp; And that’s a legitimate debate, and I encourage that 
		debate.&nbsp; But what’s not legitimate is to suggest that somehow the 
		legislation being proposed is going to encourage future taxpayer 
		bailouts, as some have claimed.&nbsp; That makes for a good sound bite, but 
		it’s not factually accurate.&nbsp; It is not true.&nbsp; In fact, the system as it 
		stands -- the system as it stands is what led to a series of massive, 
		costly taxpayer bailouts.&nbsp; And it’s only with reform that we can avoid a 
		similar outcome in the future.&nbsp; In other words, a vote for reform is a 
		vote to put a stop to taxpayer-funded bailouts.&nbsp; That’s the truth.&nbsp; End 
		of story.&nbsp; And nobody should be fooled in this debate.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">By the way, these changes 
		have the added benefit of creating incentives within the industry to 
		ensure that no one company can ever threaten to bring down the whole 
		economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To that end, the bill would 
		also enact what’s known as the Volcker Rule -- and there’s a tall guy 
		sitting in the front row here, Paul Volcker -- who we named it after.&nbsp; 
		And it does something very simple:&nbsp; It places some limits on the size of 
		banks and the kinds of risks that banking institutions can take.&nbsp; This 
		will not only safeguard our system against crises, this will also make 
		our system stronger and more competitive by instilling confidence here 
		at home and across the globe.&nbsp; Markets depend on that confidence.&nbsp; Part 
		of what led to the turmoil of the past two years was that in the absence 
		of clear rules and sound practices, people didn’t trust that our system 
		was one in which it was safe to invest or lend.&nbsp; As we’ve seen, that 
		harms all of us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So by enacting these 
		reforms, we’ll help ensure that our financial system -- and our economy 
		-- continues to be the envy of the world.&nbsp; That’s the first thing, 
		making sure that we can wind down one firm if it gets into trouble 
		without bringing the whole system down or forcing taxpayers to fund a 
		bailout.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Number two, reform would 
		bring new transparency to many financial markets.&nbsp; As you know, part of 
		what led to this crisis was firms like AIG and others who were making 
		huge and risky bets, using derivatives and other complicated financial 
		instruments, in ways that defied accountability, or even common sense.&nbsp; 
		In fact, many practices were so opaque, so confusing, so complex that 
		the people inside the firms didn’t understand them,&nbsp; much less those who 
		were charged with overseeing them.&nbsp; They weren’t fully aware of the 
		massive bets that were being placed.&nbsp; That’s what led Warren Buffett to 
		describe derivatives that were bought and sold with little oversight as 
		“financial weapons of mass destruction.”&nbsp; That’s what he called them.&nbsp; 
		And that’s why reform will rein in excess and help ensure that these 
		kinds of transactions take place in the light of day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there’s been a great 
		deal of concern about these changes.&nbsp; So I want to reiterate:&nbsp; There is 
		a legitimate role for these financial instruments in our economy.&nbsp; They 
		can help allay risk and spur investment.&nbsp; And there are a lot of 
		companies that use these instruments to that legitimate end -- they are 
		managing exposure to fluctuating prices or currencies, fluctuating 
		markets.&nbsp; For example, a business might hedge against rising oil prices 
		by buying a financial product to secure stable fuel costs, so an 
		airlines might have an interest in locking in a decent price.&nbsp; That’s 
		how markets are supposed to work.&nbsp; The problem is these markets operated 
		in the shadows of our economy, invisible to regulators, invisible to the 
		public.&nbsp; So reckless practices were rampant.&nbsp; Risks accrued until they 
		threatened our entire financial system.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why these reforms 
		are designed to respect legitimate activities but prevent reckless risk 
		taking.&nbsp; That’s why we want to ensure that financial products like 
		standardized derivatives are traded out in the open, in the full view of 
		businesses, investors, and those charged with oversight.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I was encouraged to see 
		a Republican senator join with Democrats this week in moving forward on 
		this issue.&nbsp; That's a good sign.&nbsp; That's a good sign.&nbsp; For without 
		action, we’ll continue to see what amounts to highly-leveraged, 
		loosely-monitored gambling in our financial system, putting taxpayers 
		and the economy in jeopardy.&nbsp; And the only people who ought to fear the 
		kind of oversight and transparency that we're proposing are those whose 
		conduct will fail this scrutiny.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, this plan would enact 
		the strongest consumer financial protections ever.&nbsp; And that's 
		absolutely necessary because this financial crisis wasn’t just the 
		result of decisions made in the executive suites on Wall Street; it was 
		also the result of decisions made around kitchen tables across America, 
		by folks who took on mortgages and credit cards and auto loans.&nbsp; And 
		while it’s true that many Americans took on financial obligations that 
		they knew or should have known they could not have afforded, millions of 
		others were, frankly, duped.&nbsp; They were misled by deceptive terms and 
		conditions, buried deep in the fine print.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And while a few companies 
		made out like bandits by exploiting their customers, our entire economy 
		was made more vulnerable.&nbsp; Millions of people have now lost their 
		homes.&nbsp; Tens of millions more have lost value in their homes.&nbsp; Just 
		about every sector of our economy has felt the pain, whether you’re 
		paving driveways in Arizona, or selling houses in Ohio, or you're doing 
		home repairs in California, or you’re using your home equity to start a 
		small business in Florida.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why we need to give 
		consumers more protection and more power in our financial system.&nbsp; This 
		is not about stifling competition, stifling innovation; it’s just the 
		opposite.&nbsp; With a dedicated agency setting ground rules and looking out 
		for ordinary people in our financial system, we will empower consumers 
		with clear and concise information when they’re making financial 
		decisions.&nbsp; So instead of competing to offer confusing products, 
		companies will compete the old-fashioned way, by offering better 
		products.&nbsp; And that will mean more choices for consumers, more 
		opportunities for businesses, and more stability in our financial 
		system.&nbsp; And unless your business model depends on bilking people, there 
		is little to fear from these new rules.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Number four, the last key 
		component of reform.&nbsp; These Wall Street reforms will give shareholders 
		new power in the financial system.&nbsp; They will get what we call a say on 
		pay, a voice with respect to the salaries and bonuses awarded to top 
		executives.&nbsp; And the SEC will have the authority to give shareholders 
		more say in corporate elections, so that investors and pension holders 
		have a stronger role in determining who manages the company in which 
		they’ve placed their savings.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, Americans don’t 
		begrudge anybody for success when that success is earned.&nbsp; But when we 
		read in the past, and sometimes in the present, about enormous executive 
		bonuses at firms -- even as they’re relying on assistance from taxpayers 
		or they’re taking huge risks that threaten the system as a whole or 
		their company is doing badly -- it offends our fundamental values.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not only that, some of the 
		salaries and bonuses that we’ve seen creates perverse incentives to take 
		reckless risks that contributed to the crisis.&nbsp; It’s what helped lead to 
		a relentless focus on a company’s next quarter, to the detriment of its 
		next year or its next decade.&nbsp; And it led to a situation in which folks 
		with the most to lose -- stock and pension holders -- had the least to 
		say in the process.&nbsp; And that has to change.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me close by saying 
		this.&nbsp; I have laid out a set of Wall Street reforms.&nbsp; These are reforms 
		that would put an end to taxpayer bailouts; that would bring complex 
		financial dealings out of the shadows; that would protect consumers; and 
		that would give shareholders more power in the financial system.&nbsp; But 
		let’s face it, we also need reform in Washington.&nbsp;And the debate -- the 
		debate over these changes is a perfect example.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I mean, we have seen 
		battalions of financial industry lobbyists descending on Capitol Hill, 
		firms spending millions to influence the outcome of this debate.&nbsp; We’ve 
		seen misleading arguments and attacks that are designed not to improve 
		the bill but to weaken or to kill it.&nbsp; We’ve seen a bipartisan process 
		buckle under the weight of these withering forces, even as we‘ve 
		produced a proposal that by all accounts is a commonsense, reasonable, 
		non-ideological approach to target the root problems that led to the 
		turmoil in our financial sector and ultimately in our entire economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we’ve seen business as 
		usual in Washington, but I believe we can and must put this kind of 
		cynical politics aside.&nbsp; We’ve got to put an end to it.&nbsp; That’s why I’m 
		here today. That’s why I’m here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And to those of you who are 
		in the financial sector, let me say this, we will not always see eye to 
		eye.&nbsp; We will not always agree.&nbsp; But that doesn’t mean that we’ve got to 
		choose between two extremes.&nbsp; We do not have to choose between markets 
		that are unfettered by even modest protections against crisis, or 
		markets that are stymied by onerous rules that suppress enterprise and 
		innovation.&nbsp; That is a false choice.&nbsp; And we need no more proof than the 
		crisis that we’ve just been through.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You see, there has always 
		been a tension between the desire to allow markets to function without 
		interference and the absolute necessity of rules to prevent markets from 
		falling out of kilter.&nbsp; But managing that tension, one that we’ve 
		debated since the founding of this nation, is what has allowed our 
		country to keep up with a changing world.&nbsp; For in taking up this debate, 
		in figuring out how to apply well-worn principles with each new age, we 
		ensure that we don’t tip too far one way or the other -- that our 
		democracy remains as dynamic and our economy remains as dynamic as it 
		has in the past.&nbsp; So, yes, this debate can be contentious.&nbsp; It can be 
		heated.&nbsp; But in the end it serves only to make our country stronger.&nbsp; It 
		has allowed us to adapt and to thrive.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I read a report recently 
		that I think fairly illustrates this point.&nbsp; It’s from Time Magazine.&nbsp; 
		I’m going to quote:&nbsp; “Through the great banking houses of Manhattan last 
		week ran wild-eyed alarm.&nbsp; Big bankers stared at one another in anger 
		and astonishment.&nbsp; A bill just passed… would rivet upon their 
		institutions what they considered a monstrous system… such a system, 
		they felt, would not only rob them of their pride of profession but 
		would reduce all U.S. banking to its lowest level.”&nbsp; That appeared in 
		Time Magazine in June of 1933.&nbsp; The system that caused so much 
		consternation, so much concern was the Federal Deposit Insurance 
		Corporation, also known as the FDIC, an institution that has 
		successfully secured the deposits of generations of Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end, our system only 
		works -- our markets are only free -- when there are basic safeguards 
		that prevent abuse, that check excesses, that ensure that it is more 
		profitable to play by the rules than to game the system.&nbsp; And that is 
		what the reforms we’ve been proposing are designed to achieve -- no 
		more, no less.&nbsp; And because that is how we will ensure that our economy 
		works for consumers, that it works for investors, and that it works for 
		financial institutions -- in other words, that it works for all of us -- 
		that’s why we’re working so hard to get this stuff passed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the central lesson 
		not only of this crisis but of our history.&nbsp; It’s what I said when I 
		spoke here two years ago.&nbsp; Because ultimately, there is no dividing line 
		between Main Street and Wall Street.&nbsp; We will rise or we will fall 
		together as one nation.&nbsp;And that is why I urge all of you to join me.&nbsp; I 
		urge all of you to join me, to join those who are seeking to pass these 
		commonsense reforms.&nbsp; And for those of you in the financial industry, I 
		urge you to join me not only because it is in the interest of your 
		industry, but also because it’s in the interest of your country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much.&nbsp; God 
		bless you, and God bless the United States of America.&nbsp; Thank you.</font></p>
