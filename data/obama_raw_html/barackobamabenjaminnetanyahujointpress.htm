transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>PRESIDENT OBAMA</u></b>:&nbsp;Well, let 
		me, first of all, welcome again Prime Minister Netanyahu, who I think 
		has now been here seven times during the course of my presidency.&nbsp;And I 
		want to indicate that the frequency of these meetings is an indication 
		of the extraordinary bonds between our two countries, as is the 
		opportunity for the Prime Minister to address Congress during his visit 
		here.&nbsp;I know that’s an honor that’s reserved for those who have always 
		shown themselves to be a great friend of the United States and is 
		indicative of the friendship between our countries.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamabenjaminnetanyahuovalofficesouza.jpg" width="311" height="207"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We just completed a 
		prolonged and extremely useful conversation touching on a wide range of 
		issues.&nbsp;We discussed, first of all, the changes that are sweeping the 
		region and what has been happening in places like Egypt and Syria and 
		how they affect the interests and security of the United States and 
		Israel, as well as the opportunity for prosperity, growth and 
		development in the Arab world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We agreed that there is a 
		moment of opportunity that can be seized as a consequence of the Arab 
		Spring, but also acknowledge that there’s significant perils as well, 
		and that it’s going to be important for the United States and Israel to 
		consult closely as we see developments unfold.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I outlined for the Prime 
		Minister some of the issues that I discussed in 
		<a href="barackobamamiddleeastpolicy.htm"><font color="#0000FF">my speech yesterday</font></a> -- 
		how important it was going to be for the United States to support 
		political reform, support human rights, support freedom of speech, 
		religious tolerance and economic development, particularly in Egypt, as 
		the largest Arab country, as well as Tunisia, the country that first 
		started this revolutionary movement that’s taking place throughout the 
		Middle East and North Africa.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also discussed the 
		situation in Syria, which is obviously of acute concern to Israel, given 
		its shared border.&nbsp;And I gave more details to the Prime Minister about 
		the significant steps that we are taking to try to pressure Syria and 
		the Assad regime to reform, including the sanctions that we placed 
		directly on President Assad.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We continue to share our 
		deep concerns about Iran, not only the threat that it poses to Israel 
		but also the threat that it poses to the region and the world if it were 
		to develop a nuclear weapon.&nbsp;We updated our strategy to continue to 
		apply pressure, both through sanctions and our other diplomatic work.&nbsp;And I reiterated my belief that it is unacceptable for Iran to possess a 
		nuclear weapon.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamabenjaminnetanyahu2.jpg" width="337" height="189"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also discussed the 
		hypocrisy of Iran suggesting that it somehow supports democratization in 
		the Middle East when, in fact, they first showed the repressive nature 
		of that regime when they responded to the own peaceful protests that 
		took place inside Iran almost two years ago.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, we discussed the 
		issue of a prospective peace between Israelis and Palestinians.&nbsp;And I 
		reiterated and we discussed in depth the principles that I laid out 
		yesterday -- the belief that our ultimate goal has to be a secure 
		Israeli state, a Jewish state, living side by side in peace and security 
		with a contiguous, functioning and effective Palestinian state.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Obviously there are some 
		differences between us in the precise formulations and language, and 
		that’s going to happen between friends.&nbsp;But what we are in complete 
		accord about is that a true peace can only occur if the ultimate 
		resolution allows Israel to defend itself against threats, and that 
		Israel’s security will remain paramount in U.S. evaluations of any 
		prospective peace deal.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I said that yesterday in the 
		speech, and I continue to believe it.&nbsp;And I think that it is possible 
		for us to shape a deal that allows Israel to secure itself, not to be 
		vulnerable, but also allows it to resolve what has obviously been a 
		wrenching issue for both peoples for decades now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also pointed out, as I 
		said <a href="barackobamamiddleeastpolicy.htm"><font color="#0000FF">in the speech yesterday</font></a>, that it is very difficult for Israel to be 
		expected to negotiate in a serious way with a party that refuses to 
		acknowledge its right to exist.&nbsp;And so for that reason I think the 
		Palestinians are going to have to answer some very difficult questions 
		about this agreement that’s been made between Fatah and Hamas.&nbsp;Hamas 
		has been and is an organization that has resorted to terror; that has 
		refused to acknowledge Israel’s rights to exist.&nbsp;It is not a partner 
		for a significant, realistic peace process.&nbsp;And so, as I said yesterday 
		during the speech, the Palestinians are going to have to explain how 
		they can credibly engage in serious peace negotiations in the absence of 
		observing the Quartet principles that have been put forward previously.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, overall, I thought this 
		was an extremely constructive discussion.&nbsp;And coming out of this 
		discussion, I once again can reaffirm that the extraordinarily close 
		relationship between the United States and Israel is sound and will 
		continue, and that together, hopefully we are going to be able to work 
		to usher in a new period of peace and prosperity in a region that is 
		going to be going through some very profound transformations in the 
		coming weeks, months and years.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, Mr. Prime Minister.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<hr>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/benjaminnetanyahubarackobamamaingo.jpg" width="476" height="267"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU</u></b>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>PRESIDENT OBAMA</u></b>:&nbsp;Thank you 
		very much.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU</u></b>:&nbsp;Mr. President, first I want to thank you and the First Lady for the 
		gracious hospitality that you’ve shown me, my wife, and our entire 
		delegation.&nbsp;We have an enduring bond of friendship between our two 
		countries, and I appreciate the opportunity to have this meeting with 
		you after <a href="barackobamamiddleeastpolicy.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">your important speech yesterday</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We share your hope and your 
		vision for the spread of democracy in the Middle East.&nbsp;I appreciate the 
		fact that you reaffirmed once again now, and in our conversation, and in 
		actual deed the commitment to Israel’s security. We value your efforts 
		to advance the peace process.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is something that we 
		want to have accomplished.&nbsp;Israel wants peace.&nbsp;I want peace.&nbsp;What we 
		all want is a peace that will be genuine, that will hold, that will 
		endure.&nbsp;And I think that the -- we both agree that a peace based on 
		illusions will crash eventually on the rocks of Middle Eastern reality, 
		and that the only peace that will endure is one that is based on 
		reality, on unshakeable facts.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think for there to be 
		peace, the Palestinians will have to accept some basic realities.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The 
		first is that while Israel is prepared to make generous compromises for 
		peace, it cannot go back to the 1967 lines -- because 
		<a href="http://www.defensibleborders.org/apx2.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">these lines are 
		indefensible</font></a>; because they don’t take into account certain changes that 
		have taken place on the ground, demographic changes that have taken 
		place over the last 44 years.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Remember that, before 1967, 
		Israel was all of nine miles wide. It was half the width of the 
		Washington Beltway.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And these were not the boundaries of peace; they 
		were the boundaries of repeated wars, because the attack on Israel was 
		so attractive.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we can't go back to those 
		indefensible lines, and we're going to have to have a long-term military 
		presence along the Jordan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I discussed this with the President and I 
		think that we understand that Israel has certain security requirements 
		that will have to come into place in any deal that we make.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second is -- echoes 
		something the President just said, and that is that Israel cannot 
		negotiate with a Palestinian government that is backed by Hamas.&nbsp;Hamas, 
		as the President said, is a terrorist organization committed to Israel’s 
		destruction.&nbsp;It’s fired thousands of rockets on our cities, on our 
		children.&nbsp;It’s recently fired an anti-tank rocket at a yellow school 
		bus, killing a 16-year-old boy.&nbsp;And Hamas has just attacked you, Mr. 
		President, and the United States for ridding the world of bin Laden.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So Israel obviously cannot 
		be asked to negotiate with a government that is backed by the 
		Palestinian version of al Qaeda.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think President Abbas has 
		a simple choice.&nbsp;He has to decide if he negotiates or keeps his pact 
		with Hamas, or makes peace with Israel.&nbsp;And I can only express what I 
		said to you just now, that I hope he makes the choice, the right choice, 
		in choosing peace with Israel.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The third reality is that 
		the Palestinian refugee problem will have to be resolved in the context 
		of a Palestinian state, but certainly not in the borders of Israel.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Arab attack in 1948 on 
		Israel resulted in two refugee problems -- Palestinian refugee problem 
		and Jewish refugees, roughly the same number, who were expelled from 
		Arab lands.&nbsp;Now, tiny Israel absorbed the Jewish refugees, but the vast 
		Arab world refused to absorb the Palestinian refugees.&nbsp;Now, 63 years 
		later, the Palestinians come to us and they say to Israel, accept the 
		grandchildren, really, and the great grandchildren of these refugees, 
		thereby wiping out Israel’s future as a Jewish state.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So it’s not going to 
		happen.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">Everybody knows it’s not going to happen.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/benjaminnetanyahubarackobama2.jpg" width="337" height="188"></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">And I think it’s 
		time to tell the Palestinians forthrightly it’s not going to happen.&nbsp;The Palestinian refugee problem has to be resolved.&nbsp;It can be resolved, 
		and it will be resolved if the Palestinians choose to do so in a 
		Palestinian state.&nbsp;So that's a real possibility.&nbsp;But it’s not going to 
		be resolved within the Jewish state.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The President and I 
		discussed all these issues and I think we may have differences here and 
		there, but I think there’s an overall direction that we wish to work 
		together to pursue a real, genuine peace between Israel and its 
		Palestinian neighbors; a peace that is defensible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, you're the -- 
		you're the leader of a great people, the American people.&nbsp;And I'm the 
		leader of a much smaller people, the --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>PRESIDENT OBAMA</u></b>:&nbsp;A great 
		people.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/benjaminnetanyahubarackobama3.jpg" width="337" height="189"></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU</u></b>:&nbsp;It’s a great people, too.&nbsp;It’s the ancient nation of Israel.&nbsp;And, you 
		know, we've been around for almost 4,000 years.&nbsp;We've experienced 
		struggle and suffering like no other people.&nbsp; We've gone through 
		expulsions and pogroms and massacres and the murder of millions.&nbsp;But I 
		can say that even at the dearth of -- even at the nadir of the valley of 
		death, we never lost hope and we never lost our dream of reestablishing 
		a sovereign state in our ancient homeland, the land of Israel.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And now it falls on my 
		shoulders as the Prime Minister of Israel, at a time of extraordinary 
		instability and uncertainty in the Middle East, to work with you to 
		fashion a peace that will ensure Israel’s security and will not 
		jeopardize its survival.&nbsp;I take this responsibility with pride but with 
		great humility, because, as I told you in our conversation, we don't 
		have a lot of margin for error.&nbsp;And because, Mr. President, history 
		will not give the Jewish people another chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So in the coming days and 
		weeks and months, I intend to work with you to seek a peace that will 
		address our security concerns, seek a genuine recognition that we wish 
		from our Palestinian neighbors to give a better future for Israel and 
		for the entire region.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I thank you for the 
		opportunity to exchange our views and to work together for this common 
		end.&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. President.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>PRESIDENT OBAMA</u></b>:&nbsp;Thank you.</font></p>
