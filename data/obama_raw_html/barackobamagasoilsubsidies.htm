		<div id="centerblock">
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.&nbsp; 
			Everybody, please have a seat.&nbsp; Sorry we’re running just a little 
			bit behind, but I figured it’s a great day to enjoy the Rose Garden.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, members of 
			Congress have a simple choice to make:&nbsp; They can stand with the big 
			oil companies, or they can stand with the American people.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Right now, the biggest 
			oil companies are raking in record profits –- profits that go up 
			every time folks pull up into a gas station.&nbsp; But on top of these 
			record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year -- 
			billions a year in taxpayer subsidies -- a subsidy that they’ve 
			enjoyed year after year for the last century.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Think about that.&nbsp; 
			It’s like hitting the American people twice.&nbsp; You’re already paying 
			a premium at the pump right now.&nbsp; And on top of that, Congress, up 
			until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of 
			dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s not as if these 
			companies can’t stand on their own.&nbsp; Last year, the three biggest 
			U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits.&nbsp; 
			Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.&nbsp; And when the price 
			of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companies’ 
			profits.&nbsp; In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by 
			a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in 
			quarterly profits.&nbsp; Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate 
			than most other companies on their investments, partly because we’re 
			giving them billions in tax giveaways every year.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I want to make 
			clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our 
			overall energy strategy.&nbsp; We want U.S. oil companies to be doing 
			well.&nbsp; We want them to succeed.&nbsp; That’s why under my administration, 
			we’ve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil 
			and gas production.&nbsp; We’ve quadrupled the number of operating oil 
			rigs to a record high.&nbsp; We’ve added enough oil and gas pipeline to 
			circle the Earth and then some.&nbsp; And just yesterday, we announced 
			the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the 
			Atlantic.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the fact is, we’re 
			producing more oil right now than we have in eight years, and we’re 
			importing less of it as well.&nbsp; For two years in a row, America has 
			bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home -- 
			for the first time in over a decade.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So American oil is 
			booming.&nbsp; The oil industry is doing just fine.&nbsp; With record profits 
			and rising production, I’m not worried about the big oil companies.&nbsp; 
			With high oil prices around the world, they’ve got more than enough 
			incentive to produce even more oil.&nbsp; That’s why I think it’s time 
			they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having 
			a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank.&nbsp; 
			And I think it’s curious that some folks in Congress, who are the 
			first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones 
			that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the 
			oil companies.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Instead of taxpayer 
			giveaways to an industry that’s never been more profitable, we 
			should be using that money to double-down on investments in clean 
			energy technologies that have never been more promising -- 
			investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments 
			in fuel-efficient cars and trucks, and energy-efficient homes and 
			buildings.&nbsp; That’s the future.&nbsp; That’s the only way we're going to 
			break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year 
			after year.&nbsp; As the economy is growing, the only time you start 
			seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly.&nbsp; That’s 
			not the kind of pattern that we want to be in.&nbsp; We want the economy 
			doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And keep in mind, we 
			can’t just drill our way out of this problem.&nbsp; As I said, oil 
			production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's 
			been doing well even as gas prices are going up.&nbsp; Well, the reason 
			is because we use more than 20 percent of the world’s oil but we 
			only have 2 percent of the world’s known oil reserves.&nbsp; And that 
			means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow but we’d 
			still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the 
			difference.&nbsp; We’d still have to depend on other countries to meet 
			our energy needs.&nbsp; And because it’s a world market, the fact that 
			we’re doing more here in the United States doesn’t necessarily help 
			us because even U.S. oil companies they’re selling that oil on a 
			worldwide market.&nbsp; They’re not keeping it just for us.&nbsp; And that 
			means that if there’s rising demand around the world then the prices 
			are going to up.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s not the future 
			that I want for America.&nbsp; I don’t want folks like these back here 
			and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every 
			time that there’s some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators 
			get nervous about whether there’s going to be enough supply.&nbsp; I 
			don’t want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side 
			of the world.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want us to control 
			our own destiny.&nbsp; I want us to forge our own future.&nbsp; And that’s 
			why, as long as I’m President, America is going to pursue an 
			all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue 
			developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible 
			way.&nbsp; But it also means that we’re going to keep developing more 
			advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering 
			truck fleets across America.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re going to keep 
			investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power that’s 
			already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs.&nbsp; 
			We’re going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more 
			miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks 
			instead of every week.&nbsp; We’re going to keep building more homes and 
			businesses that waste less energy so that you’re in charge of your 
			own energy bills.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re going to do all 
			of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource:&nbsp; American 
			ingenuity and American imagination.&nbsp; That’s what we need to keep 
			going.&nbsp; That’s what’s at stake right now.&nbsp; That’s the choice that we 
			face.&nbsp; And that’s the choice that’s facing Congress today.&nbsp; They can 
			either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that 
			keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer 
			subsidies that aren’t needed to boost oil production so that we can 
			invest in the future.&nbsp; It’s that simple.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as long as I’m 
			President, I’m betting on the future.&nbsp; And as the people I’ve talked 
			to around the country, including the people who are behind me here 
			today, they put their faith in the future as well.&nbsp; That’s what we 
			do as Americans.&nbsp; That’s who we are.&nbsp; We innovate.&nbsp; We discover.&nbsp; We 
			seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges.&nbsp; And, 
			ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed.&nbsp; And I believe 
			that we’re going to do that again.&nbsp; Today, the American people are 
			going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, 
			everybody.</font></div>
