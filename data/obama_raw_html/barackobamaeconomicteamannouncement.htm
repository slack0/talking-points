transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The news this past week, 
		including this morning’s news about Citigroup, has made it even more 
		clear that we are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions. Our financial markets are 
		under stress. New home purchases in October were the lowest in 
		half-a-century. Recently, more than half-a-million jobless claims were filed, 
		the highest in 18 years. And if we do not act swiftly 
		and boldly, most experts now believe that we could lose millions of jobs 
		next year.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While we can’t underestimate 
		the challenges that we face, we also can’t underestimate our capacity to 
		overcome them, to summon that spirit of determination and optimism that 
		has always defined us, and to move forward in a new direction to create 
		new jobs, reform our financial system, and fuel long-term economic 
		growth.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know this won’t be easy, 
		and it won’t happen overnight. We’ll need to bring together the best 
		minds in America to guide us, and that is what I’ve sought to do in 
		assembling my economic team. I’ve sought leaders who 
		could offer both sound judgment and fresh thinking, both a depth of 
		experience and a wealth of bold, new ideas, and most of all who share my 
		fundamental belief that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street without a 
		thriving Main Street, that in this country we rise or fall as one 
		nation, as one people.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, Vice President-elect 
		Biden and I are pleased to announce the nomination of four individuals 
		who meet these criteria to lead our economic team: 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_F._Geithner">
		<font color="#0000FF">Timothy Geithner</font></a><font color="#0000FF">,</font> as 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury">
		<font color="#0000FF">secretary of treasury</font></a>; 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers">
		<font color="#0000FF">Lawrence Summers</font></a>, as the director of our 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Economic_Council">
		<font color="#0000FF">National 
		Economic Council</font></a>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Romer">
		<font color="#0000FF">Christina Romer</font></a>, as chair of the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Economic_Advisers">
		<font color="#0000FF">Council of Economic 
		Advisers</font></a>; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_Barnes">
		<font color="#0000FF">Melody Barnes</font></a>, as director of domestic -- the 
		<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/dpc/"><font color="#0000FF">Domestic 
		Policy Council</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Having served in senior roles at Treasury, the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF"><font color="#0000FF">IMF</font></a>, and 
		the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fed">
		<font color="#0000FF">New York Fed</font></a>, Tim Geithner offers not just extensive experience 
		shaping economic policy and managing financial markets, he also has an 
		unparalleled understanding of our current economic crisis in all of its 
		depth, complexity, and urgency. Tim will waste no time 
		getting up to speed. He will start his first day on the job with a 
		unique insight into the failures of today’s markets and a clear vision 
		of the steps we must take to revive them. The reality is that the 
		economic crisis we face is no longer just an American crisis; it’s a 
		global crisis. And we will need to reach out to countries around the 
		world to craft a global response. Tim’s extensive international 
		experience makes him uniquely suited to do that work.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Growing up partly in Africa 
		and having lived and worked throughout Asia, having served as 
		undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs, one of the 
		many roles in the international arena, and having studied both Chinese 
		and Japanese, Tim understands the language of today’s international 
		markets in more ways than one. Tim served with distinction 
		under both Democrats and Republicans and has a long history of working 
		comfortably and as an honest broker on both sides of the aisle. With stellar performances 
		and outstanding results at every stage of his career, Tim has earned the 
		confidence and respect of business, financial, and community leaders, 
		members of Congress, and political leaders around the world. And I know 
		he will do so once again as America’s next treasury secretary, the chief 
		economic spokesman for my Administration.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, like Tim, Larry Summers 
		also brings a singular combination of skill, intellect, and experience to 
		the role he will play in our Administration. As undersecretary, deputy 
		secretary, and then secretary of the treasury, Larry helped guide us 
		through several major international financial crises and was a central 
		architect of the policies that led to the longest economic expansion in 
		American history, with record surpluses, rising family incomes, and more 
		than 20 million new jobs. He also championed a range 
		of measures, from tax credits to enhanced lending programs to consumer 
		financial protections, that greatly benefited middle-income families.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a thought leader, Larry 
		has urged us to confront the problems of income inequality and the 
		middle-class squeeze, consistently arguing that the key to a strong 
		economy is a strong, vibrant, growing middle class. This idea is at the 
		core of my own economic philosophy and will be the foundation of all of 
		my economic policies.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as one of the great 
		economic minds of our time, Larry has earned a global reputation for 
		being able to cut to the heart of the most complex and novel policy 
		challenges. With respect to both our current financial crisis and other 
		pressing economic issues of our time, his thinking, writing, and speaking 
		have set the terms of the debate. I’m glad he will be by my 
		side, playing the critical role of coordinating my Administration’s 
		economic policy in the White House, and I will rely heavily on his 
		advice as we navigate the uncharted waters of this economic crisis.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As one of the most expert 
		people in America on economic crises and how to solve them, my next 
		nominee, Christina Romer, will bring a critically needed perspective to 
		her work as chair of my Council of Economic Advisors. Christina is both a leading 
		-- both a leading macroeconomist and a leading economic historian, 
		perhaps best known for her work on America’s recovery from the Great 
		Depression and the robust economic expansion that followed.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since 2003, she’s been 
		co-director of the National Bureau of Economic Research Monetary 
		Economics program. She’s also a member of the bureau’s Business Cycle 
		Dating Committee, the body charged with officially determining whether a 
		recession has started and ended, experience which will serve her well as 
		she advises me on our current economic challenges. Christina has done 
		groundbreaking research on many of the topics our Administration will 
		confront, from tax policy to fighting recessions. And her clear-eyed, 
		independent analyses have received praise from both conservative and 
		liberal thinkers alike. I look forward to her wise counsel in the White 
		House.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, we know that 
		rebuilding our economy will require action on a great variety of fronts: 
		from education and health care to energy and Social Security. Without 
		sound policies in these areas, we can neither enjoy sustained economic 
		growth nor realize our full potential as a people. So I am extraordinarily 
		pleased that Melody Barnes, one of the most respected policy experts in 
		America, will serve as my director of domestic -- the Domestic Policy 
		Council, and that she will be working hand in hand with my economic 
		policy team to chart a course to economic recovery. An integral part of that 
		course will be health care reform, and she will work closely with my 
		secretary of health and human services on that issue.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As executive vice president 
		for policy at the Center of -- at the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_American_Progress">
		<font color="#0000FF">Center for American Progress</font></a>, 
		Melody directed a network of policy experts dedicated to finding 
		solutions for struggling middle-class families. She also served as chief 
		counsel to the great Senator Ted Kennedy on the state -- Senate Judiciary 
		Committee, working on issues ranging from crime to immigration to 
		bankruptcy, and fighting tirelessly to protect civil rights, women’s 
		rights, and religious freedom. Melody’s brilliant legal 
		mind and her long experience working to secure the liberties on which 
		this nation was founded, as well as to secure the opportunities for 
		those who’ve been left behind, make her a perfect fit for DPC director.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm grateful that Tim, 
		Larry, Christina, and Melody have accepted my nomination, and I am 
		looking forward to working closely with them in the months ahead. That work starts today, because the truth is, we do not have a minute to 
		waste. Right now, our economy is 
		trapped in a vicious cycle: The turmoil on Wall Street means a new round 
		of belt-tightening for families and businesses on Main Street, and as 
		folks produce less and consume less, that just deepens the problems in 
		our financial markets. These extraordinary stresses 
		on our financial system require extraordinary policy responses. And my 
		Administration will honor the public commitments made by the current 
		Administration to address this crisis.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Further, beyond any 
		immediate actions we may take, we need a recovery plan for both Wall 
		Street and Main Street, a plan that stabilizes our financial system and 
		gets credit flowing again, while at the same time addressing our growing 
		foreclosure crisis, helping our struggling auto industry, and creating 
		and saving 2.5 million jobs, jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, our 
		roads, our bridges, modernizing our schools, and creating the clean 
		energy infrastructure of the 21st century. Because at this moment, we 
		need to restore both confidence in the markets and restore confidence of 
		middle-class families, who find themselves working harder, earning less, 
		and falling further and further behind.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ve asked my economic team 
		to develop recommendations for this plan and to consult with Congress, 
		the current Administration, and the Federal Reserve on immediate 
		economic developments over the next two months. I’ve requested that they 
		brief me on these matters on a daily basis. And in the coming weeks, I 
		will provide the American people and the incoming Congress with an 
		overview of their initial recommendations. It is my hope that the new 
		Congress will begin work on an aggressive economic recovery plan when 
		they convene in early January so that our Administration can hit the 
		ground running.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With our economy in 
		distress, we cannot hesitate and we cannot delay. Our families can’t 
		afford to keep on waiting and hoping for a solution. They can’t afford 
		to watch another month of unpaid bills pile up, another semester of 
		tuition slip out of reach, another month where, instead of saving for 
		retirement, they’re dipping into their savings just to get by. And I 
		want to repeat: This will not be easy. There are no shortcuts or quick 
		fixes to this crisis, which has been many years in the making, and the 
		economy is likely to get worse before it gets better. Full recovery will 
		not happen immediately. And to make the investments 
		we need, we’ll have to scour our federal budget, line by line, and make 
		meaningful cuts and sacrifices, as well, something 
		<a href="barackobamamanagementandbudgetoffice.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">I’ll be discussing 
		further tomorrow</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Despite all of this, I am 
		hopeful about the future. I have full confidence in the wisdom and 
		ingenuity of my economic team and in the hard work, courage, and 
		sacrifice of the American people. And most of all, I believe 
		deeply in the resilience and the spirit of this nation. I know we can 
		work our way out of this crisis because we’ve done it before. And I know 
		we will succeed once again if we put aside partisanship and politics and 
		work together.</font></p>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s exactly what I intend to do as President of the 
		United States.</font></p>
