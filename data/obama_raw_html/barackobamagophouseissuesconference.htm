<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, 
		John, for the gracious introduction.&nbsp; To Mike and Eric, thank you for 
		hosting me.&nbsp; Thank you to all of you for receiving me.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; wonderful 
		to be here.&nbsp; I want to also acknowledge Mark Strand, president of the 
		Congressional Institute.&nbsp; To all the family members who are here and who 
		have to put up with us for an elective office each and every day, thank 
		you, because I know that's tough.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I very much am appreciative 
		of not only the tone of your introduction, John, but also the invitation 
		that you extended to me.&nbsp; You know what they say, &quot;Keep your friends 
		close, but visit the Republican Caucus every few months.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Part of the reason I 
		accepted your invitation to come here was because I wanted to speak with 
		all of you, and not just to all of you.&nbsp; So I'm looking forward to 
		taking your questions and having a real conversation in a few moments.&nbsp; 
		And I hope that the conversation we begin here doesn't end here; that we 
		can continue our dialogue in the days ahead.&nbsp; It's important to me that 
		we do so.&nbsp; It's important to you, I think, that we do so.&nbsp; But most 
		importantly, it's important to the American people that we do so.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've said this before, but 
		I'm a big believer not just in the value of a loyal opposition, but in 
		its necessity.&nbsp; Having differences of opinion, having a real debate 
		about matters of domestic policy and national security -- and that's not 
		something that's only good for our country, it's absolutely essential.&nbsp; 
		It's only through the process of disagreement and debate that bad ideas 
		get tossed out and good ideas get refined and made better.&nbsp; And that 
		kind of vigorous back and forth -- that imperfect but well-founded 
		process, messy as it often is -- is at the heart of our democracy.&nbsp; 
		That's what makes us the greatest nation in the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, yes, I want you to 
		challenge my ideas, and I guarantee you that after reading this I may 
		challenge a few of yours.&nbsp;I want you to stand up for your 
		beliefs, and knowing this caucus, I have no doubt that you will.&nbsp; I want 
		us to have a constructive debate.&nbsp; The only thing I don't want -- and 
		here I am listening to the American people, and I think they don't want 
		either -- is for Washington to continue being so Washington-like.&nbsp; I 
		know folks, when we're in town there, spend a lot of time reading the 
		polls and looking at focus groups and interpreting which party has the 
		upper hand in November and in 2012 and so on and so on and so on.&nbsp; 
		That's their obsession.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I'm not a pundit.&nbsp; I'm 
		just a President, so take it for what it's worth.&nbsp; But I don't believe 
		that the American people want us to focus on our job security.&nbsp; They 
		want us to focus on their job security.&nbsp;I don't think they 
		want more gridlock.&nbsp; I don't think they want more partisanship.&nbsp; I don't 
		think they want more obstruction.&nbsp; They didn't send us to Washington to 
		fight each other in some sort of political steel-cage match to see who 
		comes out alive.&nbsp; That's not what they want.&nbsp; They sent us to Washington 
		to work together, to get things done, and to solve the problems that 
		they're grappling with every single day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I think your 
		constituents would want to know that despite the fact it doesn't get a 
		lot of attention, you and I have actually worked together on a number of 
		occasions.&nbsp; There have been times where we've acted in a bipartisan 
		fashion.&nbsp; And I want to thank you and your Democratic colleagues for 
		reaching across the aisle.&nbsp; There has been, for example, broad support 
		for putting in the troops necessary in Afghanistan to deny al Qaeda safe 
		haven, to break the Taliban's momentum, and to train Afghan security 
		forces.&nbsp; There's been broad support for disrupting, dismantling, and 
		defeating al Qaeda.&nbsp; And I know that we're all united in our admiration 
		of our troops.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So it may be useful for the 
		international audience right now to understand -- and certainly for our 
		enemies to have no doubt -- whatever divisions and differences may exist 
		in Washington, the United States of America stands as one to defend our 
		country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's that same spirit of 
		bipartisanship that made it possible for me to sign a defense 
		contracting reform bill that was cosponsored by Senator McCain and 
		members of Congress here today.&nbsp; We've stood together on behalf of our 
		nation's veterans.&nbsp; Together we passed the largest increase in the VA's 
		budget in more than 30 years and supported essential veterans' health 
		care reforms to provide better access and medical care for those who 
		serve in uniform.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of you also joined 
		Democrats in supporting a Credit Card Bill of Rights and in extending 
		unemployment compensation to Americans who are out of work.&nbsp; Some of you 
		joined us in stopping tobacco companies from targeting kids, expanding 
		opportunities for young people to serve our country, and helping 
		responsible homeowners stay in their homes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we have a track record of 
		working together.&nbsp; It is possible.&nbsp; But, as John, you mentioned, on some 
		very big things, we've seen party-line votes that, I'm just going to be 
		honest, were disappointing.&nbsp; Let's start with our efforts to jumpstart 
		the economy last winter, when we were losing 700,000 jobs a month.&nbsp; Our 
		financial system teetered on the brink of collapse and the threat of a 
		second Great Depression loomed large.&nbsp; I didn't understand then, and I 
		still don't understand, why we got opposition in this caucus for almost 
		$300 billion in badly needed tax cuts for the American people, or COBRA 
		coverage to help Americans who've lost jobs in this recession to keep 
		the health insurance that they desperately needed, or opposition to 
		putting Americans to work laying broadband and rebuilding roads and 
		bridges and breaking ground on new construction projects.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There was an interesting 
		headline in CNN today:&nbsp; &quot;Americans disapprove of stimulus, but like 
		every policy in it.&quot;&nbsp; And there was a poll that showed that if you broke 
		it down into its component parts, 80 percent approved of the tax cuts, 
		80 percent approved of the infrastructure, 80 percent approved of the 
		assistance to the unemployed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, that's what the 
		Recovery Act was.&nbsp; And let's face it, some of you have been at the 
		ribbon-cuttings for some of these important projects in your 
		communities.&nbsp; Now, I understand some of you had some philosophical 
		differences perhaps on the just the concept of government spending, but, 
		as I recall, opposition was declared before we had a chance to actually 
		meet and exchange ideas.&nbsp; And I saw that as a missed opportunity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I am happy to report 
		this morning that we saw another sign that our economy is moving in the 
		right direction.&nbsp; The latest GDP numbers show that our economy is 
		growing by almost 6 percent -- that's the most since 2003.&nbsp; To put that 
		in perspective, this time last year, we weren't seeing positive job 
		growth; we were seeing the economy shrink by about 6 percent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So you've seen a 12 percent 
		reversal during the course of this year.&nbsp; This turnaround is the biggest 
		in nearly three decades -- and it didn't happen by accident.&nbsp; It 
		happened -- as economists, conservative and liberal, will attest -- 
		because of some of the steps that we took.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And by the way, you 
		mentioned a Web site out here, John --&nbsp; if you want to look at what's 
		going on, on the Recovery Act, you can look on recovery.gov -- a Web 
		site, by the way, that was Eric Cantor's idea.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, here's the point.&nbsp; 
		These are serious times, and what's required by all of us -- Democrats 
		and Republicans -- is to do what's right for our country, even if it's 
		not always what's best for our politics.&nbsp; I know it may be heresy to say 
		this, but there are things more important than good poll numbers.&nbsp; And 
		on this no one can accuse me of not living by my principles.&nbsp;A middle class that's back on its feet, an economy that 
		lifts everybody up, an America that's ascendant in the world -- that's 
		more important than winning an election.&nbsp; Our future shouldn't be shaped 
		by what's best for our politics; our politics should be shaped by what's 
		best for our future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But no matter what's 
		happened in the past, the important thing for all of us is to move 
		forward together.&nbsp; We have some issues right in front of us on which I 
		believe we should agree, because as successful as we've been in spurring 
		new economic growth, everybody understands that job growth has been 
		lagging.&nbsp; Some of that's predictable.&nbsp; Every economist will say jobs are 
		a lagging indicator, but that's no consolation for the folks who are out 
		there suffering right now.&nbsp; And since 7 million Americans have lost 
		their jobs in this recession, we've got to do everything we can to 
		accelerate it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, today, in line with what 
		I stated at the State of the Union, I've proposed a new jobs tax credit 
		for small business.&nbsp; And here's how it would work.&nbsp; Employers would get 
		a tax credit of up to $5,000 for every employee they add in 2010.&nbsp; 
		They'd get a tax break for increases in wages, as well.&nbsp; So, if you 
		raise wages for employees making under $100,000, we'd refund part of 
		your payroll tax for every dollar you increase those wages faster than 
		inflation.&nbsp; It's a simple concept.&nbsp; It's easy to understand.&nbsp; It would 
		cut taxes for more than 1 million small businesses.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I hope you join me.&nbsp; 
		Let's get this done.&nbsp; I want to eliminate the capital gains tax for 
		small business investment, and take some of the bailout money the Wall 
		Street banks have returned and use it to help community banks start 
		lending to small businesses again.&nbsp; So join me.&nbsp; I am confident that we 
		can do this together for the American people.&nbsp; And there's nothing in 
		that proposal that runs contrary to the ideological predispositions of 
		this caucus.&nbsp; The question is:&nbsp; What's going to keep us from getting 
		this done?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've proposed a modest fee 
		on the nation's largest banks and financial institutions to fully 
		recover for taxpayers' money that they provided to the financial sector 
		when it was teetering on the brink of collapse.&nbsp; And it's designed to 
		discourage them from taking reckless risks in the future.&nbsp; If you listen 
		to the American people, John, they'll tell you they want their money 
		back.&nbsp; Let's do this together, Republicans and Democrats.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I propose that we close tax 
		loopholes that reward companies for shipping American jobs overseas, and 
		instead give companies greater incentive to create jobs right here at 
		home -- right here at home.&nbsp; Surely, that's something that we can do 
		together, Republicans and Democrats.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know that we've got a 
		major fiscal challenge in reining in deficits that have been growing for 
		a decade, and threaten our future.&nbsp; That's why I've proposed a 
		three-year freeze in discretionary spending other than what we need for 
		national security.&nbsp; That's something we should do together that's 
		consistent with a lot of the talk both in Democratic caucuses and 
		Republican caucuses.&nbsp; We can't blink when it's time to actually do the 
		job.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At this point, we know that 
		the budget surpluses of the '90s occurred in part because of the 
		pay-as-you-go law, which said that, well, you should pay as you go and 
		live within our means, just like families do every day.&nbsp; Twenty-four of 
		you voted for that, and I appreciate it.&nbsp; And we were able to pass it in 
		the Senate yesterday.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the idea of a bipartisan 
		fiscal commission to confront the deficits in the long term died in the 
		Senate the other day.&nbsp; So I'm going to establish such a commission by 
		executive order and I hope that you participate, fully and genuinely, in 
		that effort, because if we're going to actually deal with our deficit 
		and debt, everybody here knows that we're going to have to do it 
		together, Republican and Democrat.&nbsp; No single party is going to make the 
		tough choices involved on its own.&nbsp; It's going to require all of us 
		doing what's right for the American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as I said in the State 
		of the Union speech, there's not just a deficit of dollars in 
		Washington, there is a deficit of trust.&nbsp; So I hope you'll support my 
		proposal to make all congressional earmarks public before they come to a 
		vote.&nbsp; And let's require lobbyists who exercise such influence to 
		publicly disclose all their contacts on behalf of their clients, whether 
		they are contacts with my administration or contacts with Congress.&nbsp; 
		Let's do the people's business in the bright light of day, together, 
		Republicans and Democrats.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know how bitter and 
		contentious the issue of health insurance reform has become.&nbsp; And I will 
		eagerly look at the ideas and better solutions on the health care 
		front.&nbsp; If anyone here truly believes our health insurance system is 
		working well for people, I respect your right to say so, but I just 
		don't agree.&nbsp; And neither would millions of Americans with preexisting 
		conditions who can't get coverage today or find out that they lose their 
		insurance just as they're getting seriously ill.&nbsp; That's exactly when 
		you need insurance.&nbsp; And for too many people, they're not getting it.&nbsp; I 
		don't think a system is working when small businesses are gouged and 
		15,000 Americans are losing coverage every single day; when premiums 
		have doubled and out-of-pocket costs have exploded and they're poised to 
		do so again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I mean, to be fair, the 
		status quo is working for the insurance industry, but it's not working 
		for the American people.&nbsp; It's not working for our federal budget.&nbsp; It 
		needs to change.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a big problem, and 
		all of us are called on to solve it.&nbsp; And that's why, from the start, I 
		sought out and supported ideas from Republicans.&nbsp; I even talked about an 
		issue that has been a holy grail for a lot of you, which was tort 
		reform, and said that I'd be willing to work together as part of a 
		comprehensive package to deal with it.&nbsp; I just didn't get a lot of 
		nibbles.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Creating a high-risk pool 
		for uninsured folks with preexisting conditions, that wasn't my idea, it 
		was Senator McCain's.&nbsp; And I supported it, and it got incorporated into 
		our approach.&nbsp; Allowing insurance companies to sell coverage across 
		state lines to add choice and competition and bring down costs for 
		businesses and consumers -- that's an idea that some of you I suspect 
		included in this better solutions; that's an idea that was incorporated 
		into our package.&nbsp; And I support it, provided that we do it hand in hand 
		with broader reforms that protect benefits and protect patients and 
		protect the American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A number of you have 
		suggested creating pools where self-employed and small businesses could 
		buy insurance.&nbsp; That was a good idea.&nbsp; I embraced it.&nbsp; Some of you 
		supported efforts to provide insurance to children and let kids remain 
		covered on their parents' insurance until they're 25 or 26.&nbsp; I supported 
		that.&nbsp; That's part of our package.&nbsp; I supported a number of other ideas, 
		from incentivizing wellness to creating an affordable catastrophic 
		insurance option for young people that came from Republicans like Mike 
		Enzi and Olympia Snowe in the Senate, and I'm sure from some of you as 
		well.&nbsp; So when you say I ought to be willing to accept Republican ideas 
		on health care, let's be clear:&nbsp; I have.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bipartisanship -- not for 
		its own sake but to solve problems -- that's what our constituents, the 
		American people, need from us right now.&nbsp; All of us then have a choice 
		to make.&nbsp; We have to choose whether we're going to be politicians first 
		or partners for progress; whether we're going to put success at the 
		polls ahead of the lasting success we can achieve together for America.&nbsp; 
		Just think about it for a while.&nbsp; We don't have to put it up for a vote 
		today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me close by saying 
		this.&nbsp; I was not elected by Democrats or Republicans, but by the 
		American people.&nbsp; That's especially true because the fastest growing 
		group of Americans are independents.&nbsp; That should tell us both 
		something.&nbsp; I'm ready and eager to work with anyone who is willing to 
		proceed in a spirit of goodwill.&nbsp; But understand, if we can't break free 
		from partisan gridlock, if we can't move past a politics of &quot;no,&quot; if 
		resistance supplants constructive debate, I still have to meet my 
		responsibilities as President.&nbsp; I've got to act for the greater good –- 
		because that, too, is a commitment that I have made.&nbsp; And that's -- 
		that, too, is what the American people sent me to Washington to do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I am optimistic.&nbsp; I 
		know many of you individually.&nbsp; And the irony, I think, of our political 
		climate right now is that, compared to other countries, the differences 
		between the two major parties on most issues is not as big as it's 
		represented.&nbsp; But we've gotten caught up in the political game in a way 
		that's just not healthy.&nbsp; It's dividing our country in ways that are 
		preventing us from meeting the challenges of the 21st century.&nbsp; I'm 
		hopeful that the conversation we have today can help reverse that.</font></p>

		microphone] Number two, our pledge to you, Mr. President, was that door 
		is always open.&nbsp; And we hope the [inaudible] of our invitation that we 
		[inaudible].</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, several of us 
		in this conference yesterday on the way into Baltimore stopped by the 
		Salvation Army homeless facility here in Baltimore.&nbsp; I met a little boy, 
		an African American boy, in the 8th grade, named David Carter, Jr.&nbsp; When 
		he heard that I would be seeing you today his eyes lit up like I had 
		never seen.&nbsp; And I told him that if he wrote you a letter I'd give it to 
		you, and I have.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I had a conversation 
		with little David, Jr. and David, Sr.&nbsp; His family has been struggling 
		with the economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">[On microphone.]&nbsp; His dad 
		said words to me, Mr. President, that I'll never forget.&nbsp; About my age 
		and he said -- he said, Congressman, it's not like it was when we were 
		coming up.&nbsp; He said, there's just no jobs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, last year about 
		the time you met with us, unemployment was 7.5 percent in this country.&nbsp; 
		Your administration, and your party in Congress, told us that we'd have 
		to borrow more than $700 billion to pay for a so-called stimulus bill.&nbsp; 
		It was a piecemeal list of projects and boutique tax cuts, all of which 
		was -- we were told -- had to be passed or unemployment would go to 8 
		percent, as your administration said.&nbsp; Well, unemployment is 10 percent 
		now, as you well know, Mr. President; here in Baltimore it's 
		considerably higher.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, Republicans 
		offered a stimulus bill at the same time.&nbsp; It cost half as much as the 
		Democratic proposal in Congress, and using your economic analyst models, 
		it would have created twice the jobs at half the cost.&nbsp; It essentially 
		was across-the-board tax relief, Mr. President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now we know you've come to 
		Baltimore today and you've raised this tax credit, which was last 
		promoted by President Jimmy Carter.&nbsp; But the first question I would pose 
		to you, very respectfully, Mr. President, is would you be willing to 
		consider embracing -- in the name of little David Carter, Jr. and his 
		dad, in the name of every struggling family in this country -- the kind 
		of across-the-board tax relief that Republicans have advocated, that 
		President Kennedy advocated, that President Reagan advocated and that 
		has always been the means of stimulating broad-based economic growth?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Well, there 
		was a lot packed into that question.&nbsp;First of all, let me 
		say I already promised that I'll be writing back to that young man and 
		his family, and I appreciate you passing on the letter.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#CE0A04">
		Member:</font></b> Thank you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; But let's 
		talk about just the jobs environment generally.&nbsp; You're absolutely right 
		that when I was sworn in the hope was that unemployment would remain 
		around 8 [percent], or in the 8 percent range.&nbsp; That was just based on 
		the estimates made by both conservative and liberal economists, because 
		at that point not all the data had trickled in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We had lost 650,000 jobs in 
		December.&nbsp; I'm assuming you're not faulting my policies for that.&nbsp; We 
		had lost, it turns out, 700,000 jobs in January, the month I was sworn 
		in.&nbsp; I'm assuming it wasn't my administration's policies that accounted 
		for that.&nbsp; We lost another 650,000 jobs the subsequent month, before any 
		of my policies had gone into effect.&nbsp; So I'm assuming that wasn't as a 
		consequence of our policies; that doesn't reflect the failure of the 
		Recovery Act.&nbsp; The point being that what ended up happening was that the 
		job losses from this recession proved to be much more severe -- in the 
		first quarter of last year going into the second quarter of last year -- 
		than anybody anticipated.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I mean, I think we can 
		score political points on the basis of the fact that we underestimated 
		how severe the job losses were going to be.&nbsp; But those job losses took 
		place before any stimulus, whether it was the ones that you guys have 
		proposed or the ones that we proposed, could have ever taken into 
		effect.&nbsp; Now, that's just the fact, Mike, and I don't think anybody 
		would dispute that.&nbsp; You could not find an economist who would dispute 
		that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, at the same time, as I 
		mentioned, most economists -- Republican and Democrat, liberal and 
		conservative -- would say that had it not been for the stimulus package 
		that we passed, things would be much worse.&nbsp; Now, they didn't fill a 7 
		million hole in the number of people who were unemployed.&nbsp; They probably 
		account for about 2 million, which means we still have 5 million folks 
		in there that we've still got to deal with.&nbsp; That's a lot of people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The package that we put 
		together at the beginning of the year, the truth is, should have 
		reflected -- and I believe reflected what most of you would say are 
		common sense things.&nbsp; This notion that this was a radical package is 
		just not true.&nbsp; A third of them were tax cuts, and they weren't -- when 
		you say they were &quot;boutique&quot; tax cuts, Mike, 95 percent of working 
		Americans got tax cuts, small businesses got tax cuts, large businesses 
		got help in terms of their depreciation schedules.&nbsp; I mean, it was a 
		pretty conventional list of tax cuts.&nbsp; A third of it was stabilizing 
		state budgets.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is not a single person 
		in here who, had it not been for what was in the stimulus package, 
		wouldn't be going home to more teachers laid off, more firefighters laid 
		off, more cops laid off.&nbsp; A big chunk of it was unemployment insurance 
		and COBRA, just making sure that people had some floor beneath them, 
		and, by the way, making sure that there was enough money in their 
		pockets that businesses had some customers.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You take those two 
		things out, that accounts for the majority of the stimulus package.&nbsp; Are 
		there people in this room who think that was a bad idea?&nbsp; A portion of 
		it was dealing with the AMT, the alternative minimum tax -- not a 
		proposal of mine; that's not a consequence of my policies that we have a 
		tax system where we keep on putting off a potential tax hike that is 
		embedded in the budget that we have to fix each year.&nbsp; That cost about 
		$70 billion.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then the last 
		portion of it was infrastructure which, as I said, a lot of you have 
		gone to appear at ribbon-cuttings for the same projects that you voted 
		against.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I say all this not 
		to re-litigate the past, but it's simply to state that the component 
		parts of the Recovery Act are consistent with what many of you say are 
		important things to do -- rebuilding our infrastructure, tax cuts for 
		families and businesses, and making sure that we were providing states 
		and individuals some support when the roof was caving in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the notion that I 
		would somehow resist doing something that cost half as much but would 
		produce twice as many jobs -- why would I resist that?&nbsp; I wouldn't.&nbsp; I 
		mean, that's my point, is that -- I am not an ideologue.&nbsp; I'm not.&nbsp; It 
		doesn't make sense if somebody could tell me you could do this cheaper 
		and get increased results that I wouldn't say, great.&nbsp; The problem is, I 
		couldn't find credible economists who would back up the claims that you 
		just made.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we can -- here's 
		what I know going forward, though.&nbsp; I mean, we're talking -- we were 
		talking about the past.&nbsp; We can talk about this going forward.&nbsp; I have 
		looked at every idea out there in terms of accelerating job growth to 
		match the economic growth that's already taken place.&nbsp; The jobs credit 
		that I'm discussing right now is one that a lot of people think would be 
		the most cost-effective way for encouraging people to pick up their 
		hiring.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There may be other 
		ideas that you guys have; I am happy to look at them and I'm happy to 
		embrace them.&nbsp; I suspect I will embrace some of them.&nbsp; Some of them I've 
		already embraced.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the question I 
		think we're going to have to ask ourselves is, as we move forward, are 
		we going to be examining each of these issues based on what's good for 
		the country, what the evidence tells us, or are we going to be trying to 
		position ourselves so that come November we're able to say, &quot;The other 
		party, it's their fault.&quot;&nbsp; If we take the latter approach then we're 
		probably not going to get much agreement.&nbsp; If we take the former, I 
		suspect there's going to be a lot of overlap.&nbsp; All right?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">
		Congressman Pence: </font></b>&nbsp;Mr. President, 
		will you consider supporting across-the-board tax relief, as President 
		Kennedy did?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Here's 
		what I'm going to do, Mike.&nbsp; What I'm going to do is I'm going to take a 
		look at what you guys are proposing.&nbsp; And the reason I say this, before 
		you say, &quot;Okay,&quot; I think is important to know -- what you may consider 
		across-the-board tax cuts could be, for example, greater tax cuts for 
		people who are making a billion dollars.&nbsp; I may not agree to a tax cut 
		for Warren Buffet.&nbsp; You may be calling for an across-the-board tax cut 
		for the banking industry right now.&nbsp; I may not agree to that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I think that we've 
		got to look at what specific proposals you're putting forward, and -- 
		this is the last point I'll make -- if you're calling for just 
		across-the-board tax cuts, and then on the other hand saying that we're 
		somehow going to balance our budget, I'm going to want to take a look at 
		your math and see how that works, because the issue of deficit and debt 
		is another area where there has been a tendency for some inconsistent 
		statements.&nbsp; How's that?&nbsp; All right?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman 
		Ryan:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		Thank you.&nbsp; Mr. President, first off, thanks for agreeing to accept our 
		invitation here.&nbsp; It is a real pleasure and honor to have you with us 
		here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Good to 
		see you.&nbsp; Is this your crew right here, by the way?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman 
		Ryan:</font></b>&nbsp; It 
		is.&nbsp; This is my daughter Liza, my son Charlie and Sam, and this is my 
		wife Janna.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		<b><font color="#000048">President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Hey, guys.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman 
		Ryan:</font></b>&nbsp; Say hi, 
		everybody. I serve as a ranking member of the budget 
		committee, so I'm going to talk a little budget if you don't mind.&nbsp; The 
		spending bills that you've signed into law, the domestic discretionary 
		spending has been increased by 84 percent.&nbsp; You now want to freeze 
		spending at this elevated beginning next year.&nbsp; This means that total 
		spending in your budget would grow at 3/100ths of 1 percent less than 
		otherwise.&nbsp; I would simply submit that we could do more and start now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You've also said that 
		you want to take a scalpel to the budget and go through it line by 
		line.&nbsp; We want to give you that scalpel.&nbsp; I have a proposal with my home 
		state senator, Russ Feingold, bipartisan proposal, to create a 
		constitutional version of the line-item veto.&nbsp;Problem is, 
		we can't even get a vote on the proposal.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So my question is, why not 
		start freezing spending now, and would you support a line-item veto in 
		helping us get a vote on it in the House?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Let me 
		respond to the two specific questions, but I want to just push back a 
		little bit on the underlying premise about us increasing spending by 84 
		percent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, look, I talked to 
		Peter Orszag right before I came here, because I suspected I'd be 
		hearing this -- I'd be hearing this argument.&nbsp; The fact of the matter 
		is, is that most of the increases in this year's budget, this past 
		year's budget, were not as a consequence of policies that we initiated 
		but instead were built in as a consequence of the automatic stabilizers 
		that kick in because of this enormous recession.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the increase in the 
		budget for this past year was actually predicted before I was even sworn 
		into office and had initiated any policies.&nbsp; Whoever was in there, Paul 
		-- and I don't think you'll dispute that -- whoever was in there would 
		have seen those same increases because of, on the one hand, huge drops 
		in revenue, but at the same time people were hurting and needed help.&nbsp; 
		And a lot of these things happened automatically.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the reason that 
		I'm not proposing the discretionary freeze take into effect this year -- 
		we prepared a budget for 2010, it's now going forward -- is, again, I am 
		just listening to the consensus among people who know the economy best.&nbsp; 
		And what they will say is that if you either increase taxes or 
		significantly lowered spending when the economy remains somewhat 
		fragile, that that would have a destimulative effect and potentially 
		you'd see a lot of folks losing business, more folks potentially losing 
		jobs.&nbsp; That would be a mistake when the economy has not fully taken 
		off.&nbsp; That's why I've proposed to do it for the next fiscal year.&nbsp; So 
		that's point number two.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With respect to the 
		line-item veto, I actually -- I think there's not a President out there 
		that wouldn't love to have it.&nbsp; And I think that this is an area where 
		we can have a serious conversation.&nbsp; I know it is a bipartisan proposal 
		by you and Russ Feingold.&nbsp; I don't like being held up with big bills 
		that have stuff in them that are wasteful but I've got to sign because 
		it's a defense authorization bill and I've got to make sure that our 
		troops are getting the funding that they need.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will tell you, I 
		would love for Congress itself to show discipline on both sides of the 
		aisle.&nbsp; I think one thing that you have to acknowledge, Paul, because 
		you study this stuff and take it pretty seriously, that the earmarks 
		problem is not unique to one party and you end up getting a lot of 
		pushback when you start going after specific projects of any one of you 
		in your districts, because wasteful spending is usually spent somehow 
		outside of your district.&nbsp; Have you noticed that?&nbsp; The spending in your 
		district tends to seem pretty sensible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I would love to see 
		more restraint within Congress.&nbsp; I'd like to work on the earmarks 
		reforms that I mentioned in terms of putting earmarks online, because I 
		think sunshine is the best disinfectant.&nbsp; But I am willing to have a 
		serious conversation on the line-item veto issue.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman 
		Ryan:</font></b>&nbsp; I'd 
		like to walk you through that, because we have a version we think is 
		constitutional.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Let me 
		take a look at it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman 
		Ryan:</font></b>&nbsp; I 
		would simply say that automatic stabilizer spending is mandatory 
		spending.&nbsp; The discretionary spending, the bills that Congress signs 
		that you sign into law, that has increased 84 percent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; We'll 
		have a longer debate on the budget numbers, all right?</font></p>

		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congresswoman Capito:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		Thank you, Mr. President, for joining us here today.&nbsp; As you said in the 
		State of the Union address on Wednesday, jobs and the economy are number 
		one.&nbsp; And I think everyone in this room, certainly I, agree with you on 
		that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I represent the state 
		of West Virginia.&nbsp; We're resource-rich.&nbsp; We have a lot of coal and a lot 
		of natural gas.&nbsp; But our -- my miners and the folks who are working and 
		those who are unemployed are very concerned about some of your policies 
		in these areas:&nbsp; cap and trade, an aggressive EPA, and the looming 
		prospect of higher taxes.&nbsp; In our minds, these are job-killing 
		policies.&nbsp; So I'm asking you if you would be willing to re-look at some 
		of these policies, with a high unemployment and the unsure economy that 
		we have now, to assure West Virginians that you're listening.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Look, I 
		listen all the time, including to your governor, who's somebody who I 
		enjoyed working with a lot before the campaign and now that I'm 
		President.&nbsp; And I know that West Virginia struggles with unemployment, 
		and I know how important coal is to West Virginia and a lot of the 
		natural resources there.&nbsp; That's part of the reason why I've said that 
		we need a comprehensive energy policy that sets us up for a long-term 
		future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For example, nobody has 
		been a bigger promoter of clean coal technology than I am.&nbsp; Testament to 
		that, I ended up being in a whole bunch of advertisements that you guys 
		saw all the time about investing in ways for us to burn coal more 
		cleanly.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've said that I'm a 
		promoter of nuclear energy, something that I think over the last three 
		decades has been subject to a lot of partisan wrangling and ideological 
		wrangling.&nbsp; I don't think it makes sense.&nbsp; I think that that has to be 
		part of our energy mix.&nbsp; I've said that I am supportive -- and I said 
		this two nights ago at the State of the Union -- that I am in favor of 
		increased production.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So if you look at the 
		ideas that this caucus has, again with respect to energy, I'm for a lot 
		of what you said you are for.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The one thing that I've also 
		said, though, and here we have a serious disagreement and my hope is we 
		can work through these disagreements -- there's going to be an effort on 
		the Senate side to do so on a bipartisan basis -- is that we have to 
		plan for the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the future is that clean 
		energy -- cleaner forms of energy are going to be increasingly 
		important, because even if folks are still skeptical in some cases about 
		climate change in our politics and in Congress, the world is not 
		skeptical about it.&nbsp; If we're going to be after some of these big 
		markets, they're going to be looking to see, is the United States the 
		one that's developing clean coal technology?&nbsp; Is the United States 
		developing our natural gas resources in the most effective way?&nbsp; Is the 
		United States the one that is going to lead in electric cars?&nbsp; Because 
		if we're not leading, those other countries are going to be leading.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what I want to do is work 
		with West Virginia to figure out how we can seize that future.&nbsp; But to 
		do that, that means there's going to have to be some transition.&nbsp; We 
		can't operate the coal industry in the United States as if we're still 
		in the 1920s or the 1930s or the 1950s.&nbsp; We've got to be thinking what 
		does that industry look like in the next hundred years.&nbsp; And it's going 
		to be different.&nbsp; And that means there's going to be some transition.&nbsp; 
		And that's where I think a well-thought-through policy of incentivizing 
		the new while recognizing that there's going to be a transition process 
		-- and we're not just suddenly putting the old out of business right 
		away -- that has to be something that both Republicans and Democrats 
		should be able to embrace.</font></p>

		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; That 
		was a long list, so -- let me respond.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Look, the truth of the 
		matter is that if you look at the health care process -- just over the 
		course of the year -- overwhelmingly the majority of it actually was on 
		C-SPAN, because it was taking place in congressional hearings in which 
		you guys were participating.&nbsp; I mean, how many committees were there 
		that helped to shape this bill?&nbsp; Countless hearings took place.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I kicked it off, 
		by the way, with a meeting with many of you, including your key 
		leadership.&nbsp; What is true, there's no doubt about it, is that once it 
		got through the committee process and there were now a series of 
		meetings taking place all over the Capitol trying to figure out how to 
		get the thing together -- that was a messy process.&nbsp; And I take 
		responsibility for not having structured it in a way where it was all 
		taking place in one place that could be filmed.&nbsp; How to do that 
		logistically would not have been as easy as it sounds, because you're 
		shuttling back and forth between the House, the Senate, different 
		offices, et cetera, different legislators.&nbsp; But I think it's a 
		legitimate criticism.&nbsp; So on that one, I take responsibility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With respect to 
		earmarks, we didn't have earmarks in the Recovery Act.&nbsp; We didn't get a 
		lot of credit for it, but there were no earmarks in that.&nbsp; I was 
		confronted at the beginning of my term with an omnibus package that did 
		have a lot of earmarks from Republicans and Democrats, and a lot of 
		people in this chamber.&nbsp; And the question was whether I was going to 
		have a big budget fight, at a time when I was still trying to figure out 
		whether or not the financial system was melting down and we had to make 
		a whole bunch of emergency decisions about the economy.&nbsp; So what I said 
		was let's keep them to a minimum, but I couldn't excise them all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the challenge I 
		guess I would have for you as a freshman, is what are you doing inside 
		your caucus to make sure that I'm not the only guy who is responsible 
		for this stuff, so that we're working together, because this is going to 
		be a process?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When we talk about 
		earmarks, I think all of us are willing to acknowledge that some of them 
		are perfectly defensible, good projects; it's just they haven't gone 
		through the regular appropriations process in the full light of day.&nbsp; So 
		one place to start is to make sure that they are at least transparent, 
		that everybody knows what's there before we move forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In terms of lobbyists, 
		I can stand here unequivocally and say that there has not been an 
		administration who was tougher on making sure that lobbyists weren't 
		participating in the administration than any administration that's come 
		before us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, what we did was, 
		if there were lobbyists who were on boards and commissions that were 
		carryovers and their term hadn't been completed, we didn't kick them 
		off.&nbsp; We simply said that moving forward any time a new slot opens, 
		they're being replaced.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we've actually been 
		very consistent in making sure that we are eliminating the impact of 
		lobbyists, day in, day out, on how this administration operates.&nbsp; There 
		have been a handful of waivers where somebody is highly skilled -- for 
		example, a doctor who ran Tobacco-Free Kids technically is a registered 
		lobbyist; on the other end, has more experience than anybody in figuring 
		out how kids don't get hooked on cigarettes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So there have been a 
		couple of instances like that, but generally we've been very consistent 
		on that front.</font></p>

		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congresswoman Blackburn</font></b>:&nbsp; 
		Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for acknowledging that we have 
		ideas on health care because, indeed, we do have ideas, we have plans, 
		we have over 50 bills, we have lots of amendments that would bring 
		health care ideas to the forefront.&nbsp; We would -- we've got plans to 
		lower cost, to change purchasing models, address medical liability, 
		insurance accountability, chronic and preexisting conditions, and access 
		to affordable care for those with those conditions, insurance 
		portability, expanded access -- but not doing it with creating more 
		government, more bureaucracy, and more cost for the American taxpayer.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we look forward to 
		sharing those ideas with you.&nbsp; We want to work with you on health reform 
		and making certain that we do it in an affordable, cost-effective way 
		that is going to reduce bureaucracy, reduce government interference, and 
		reduce costs to individuals and to taxpayers.&nbsp; And if those good ideas 
		aren't making it to you, maybe it's the House Democrat leadership that 
		is an impediment instead of a conduit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we're concerned 
		also that there are some lessons learned from public option health care 
		plans that maybe are not being heeded.&nbsp; And certainly in my state of 
		Tennessee, we were the test case for public option health care in 1994, 
		and our Democrat government has even cautioned that maybe our 
		experiences there would provide some lessons learned that should be 
		heeded, and would provide guidance for us to go forward.&nbsp; And as you 
		said, what we should be doing is tossing old ideas out, bad ideas out, 
		and moving forward in refining good ideas.&nbsp; And certainly we would 
		welcome that opportunity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So my question to you is, 
		when will we look forward to starting anew and sitting down with you to 
		put all of these ideas on the table, to look at these lessons learned, 
		to benefit from that experience, and to produce a product that is going 
		to reduce government interference, reduce cost, and be fair to the 
		American taxpayer?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		Actually, I've gotten many of your ideas.&nbsp; I've taken a look at them, 
		even before I was handed this.&nbsp; Some of the ideas we have embraced in 
		our package.&nbsp; Some of them are embraced with caveats.&nbsp; So let me give 
		you an example.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think one of the 
		proposals that has been focused on by the Republicans as a way to reduce 
		costs is allowing insurance companies to sell across state lines.&nbsp; We 
		actually include that as part of our approach.&nbsp; But the caveat is, we've 
		got to do so with some minimum standards, because otherwise what happens 
		is that you could have insurance companies circumvent a whole bunch of 
		state regulations about basic benefits or what have you, making sure 
		that a woman is able to get mammograms as part of preventive care, for 
		example.&nbsp; Part of what could happen is insurance companies could go into 
		states and cherry-pick and just get those who are healthiest and leave 
		behind those who are least healthy, which would raise everybody's 
		premiums who weren't healthy, right?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So it's not that many 
		of these ideas aren't workable, but we have to refine them to make sure 
		that they don't just end up worsening the situation for folks rather 
		than making it better.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, what I said at the 
		State of the Union is what I still believe:&nbsp; If you can show me -- and 
		if I get confirmation from health care experts, people who know the 
		system and how it works, including doctors and nurses -- ways of 
		reducing people's premiums; covering those who do not have insurance; 
		making it more affordable for small businesses; having insurance reforms 
		that ensure people have insurance even when they've got preexisting 
		conditions, that their coverage is not dropped just because they're 
		sick, that young people right out of college or as they're entering in 
		the workforce can still get health insurance -- if those component parts 
		are things that you care about and want to do, I'm game.&nbsp; And I've got 
		-- and I've got a lot of these ideas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The last thing I will 
		say, though -- let me say this about health care and the health care 
		debate, because I think it also bears on a whole lot of other issues.&nbsp; 
		If you look at the package that we've presented -- and there's some 
		stray cats and dogs that got in there that we were eliminating, we were 
		in the process of eliminating.&nbsp; For example, we said from the start that 
		it was going to be important for us to be consistent in saying to people 
		if you can have your -- if you want to keep the health insurance you 
		got, you can keep it, that you're not going to have anybody getting in 
		between you and your doctor in your decision making.&nbsp; And I think that 
		some of the provisions that got snuck in might have violated that 
		pledge.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so we were in the 
		process of scrubbing this and making sure that it's tight.&nbsp; But at its 
		core, if you look at the basic proposal that we've put forward:&nbsp; it has 
		an exchange so that businesses and the self-employed can buy into a pool 
		and can get bargaining power the same way big companies do; the 
		insurance reforms that I've already discussed, making sure that there's 
		choice and competition for those who don't have health insurance.&nbsp; The 
		component parts of this thing are pretty similar to what Howard Baker, 
		Bob Dole, and Tom Daschle proposed at the beginning of this debate last 
		year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, you may not agree 
		with Bob Dole and Howard Baker, and, certainly you don't agree with Tom 
		Daschle on much, but that's not a radical bunch.&nbsp; But if you were to 
		listen to the debate and, frankly, how some of you went after this bill, 
		you'd think that this thing was some Bolshevik plot.&nbsp; No, I mean, that's 
		how you guys -- that's how you guys presented it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so I'm thinking to 
		myself, well, how is it that a plan that is pretty centrist -- no, look, 
		I mean, I'm just saying, I know you guys disagree, but if you look at 
		the facts of this bill, most independent observers would say this is 
		actually what many Republicans -- is similar to what many Republicans 
		proposed to Bill Clinton when he was doing his debate on health care.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So all I'm saying is, 
		we've got to close the gap a little bit between the rhetoric and the 
		reality.&nbsp; I'm not suggesting that we're going to agree on everything, 
		whether it's on health care or energy or what have you, but if the way 
		these issues are being presented by the Republicans is that this is some 
		wild-eyed plot to impose huge government in every aspect of our lives, 
		what happens is you guys then don't have a lot of room to negotiate with 
		me.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I mean, the fact of the 
		matter is, is that many of you, if you voted with the administration on 
		something, are politically vulnerable in your own base, in your own 
		party.&nbsp; You've given yourselves very little room to work in a bipartisan 
		fashion because what you've been telling your constituents is, this guy 
		is doing all kinds of crazy stuff that's going to destroy America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I would just say 
		that we have to think about tone.&nbsp; It's not just on your side, by the 
		way -- it's on our side, as well.&nbsp; This is part of what's happened in 
		our politics, where we demonize the other side so much that when it 
		comes to actually getting things done, it becomes tough to do.</font></p>

		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman Price:</font></b>&nbsp; Mr. 
		President, thank you.&nbsp; I want to stick on the general topic of health 
		care, but ask a very specific question.&nbsp; You have repeatedly said, most 
		recently at the State of the Union, that Republicans have offered no 
		ideas and no solutions.&nbsp; In spite of the fact --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; I don't 
		think I said that.&nbsp; What I said was, within the context of health care 
		-- I remember that speech pretty well, it was only two days ago -- 
		I said I welcome ideas that you might provide.&nbsp; I didn't 
		say that you haven't provided ideas.&nbsp; I said I welcome those ideas that 
		you'll provide.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman Price:</font></b>&nbsp; Mr. 
		President, multiple times, from your administration, there have come 
		statements that Republicans have no ideas and no solutions.&nbsp; In spite of 
		the fact that we've offered, as demonstrated today, positive solutions 
		to all of the challenges we face, including energy and the economy and 
		health care, specifically in the area of health care -- this bill, 
		H.R.3400, that has more co-sponsors than any health care bill in the 
		House, is a bill that would provide health coverage for all Americans; 
		would correct the significant insurance challenges of affordability and 
		preexisting; would solve the lawsuit abuse issue, which isn't addressed 
		significantly in the other proposals that went through the House and the 
		Senate; would write into law that medical decisions are made between 
		patients and families and doctors; and does all of that without raising 
		taxes by a penny.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But my specific question is, 
		what should we tell our constituents who know that Republicans have 
		offered positive solutions to the challenges that Americans face and yet 
		continue to hear out of the administration that we've offered nothing?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Tom, 
		look, I have to say that on the -- let's just take the health care 
		debate.&nbsp; And it's probably not constructive for us to try to debate a 
		particular bill -- this isn't the venue to do it.&nbsp; But if you say, &quot;We 
		can offer coverage for all Americans, and it won't cost a penny,&quot; that's 
		just not true.&nbsp; You can't structure a bill where suddenly 30 million 
		people have coverage, and it costs nothing.&nbsp; If --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman Price:</font></b>&nbsp; Mr. 
		President, can I -- and I understand that we're not interested in 
		debating this bill, but what should we tell our constituents who know 
		that we've offered these solutions and yet hear from the administration 
		that we have offered nothing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Let me 
		-- I'm using this as a specific example, so let me answer your 
		question.&nbsp; You asked a question; I want to answer it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's not enough if you 
		say, for example, that we've offered a health care plan and I look up -- 
		this is just under the section that you've just provided me, or the book 
		that you just provided me -- summary of GOP health care reform bill:&nbsp; 
		The GOP plan will lower health care premiums for American families and 
		small businesses, addressing America's number-one priority for health 
		reform.&nbsp; I mean, that's an idea that we all embrace.&nbsp; But specifically 
		it's got to work.&nbsp; I mean, there's got to be a mechanism in these plans 
		that I can go to an independent health care expert and say, is this 
		something that will actually work, or is it boilerplate?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If I'm told, for example, 
		that the solution to dealing with health care costs is tort reform, 
		something that I've said I am willing to work with you on, but the CBO 
		or other experts say to me, at best, this could reduce health care costs 
		relative to where they're growing by a couple of percentage points, or 
		save $5 billion a year, that's what we can score it at, and it will not 
		bend the cost curve long term or reduce premiums significantly -- then 
		you can't make the claim that that's the only thing that we have to do.&nbsp; 
		If we're going to do multi-state insurance so that people can go across 
		state lines, I've got to be able to go to an independent health care 
		expert, Republican or Democrat, who can tell me that this won't result 
		in cherry-picking of the healthiest going to some and the least healthy 
		being worse off.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I am absolutely committed 
		to working with you on these issues, but it can't just be political 
		assertions that aren't substantiated when it comes to the actual details 
		of policy.&nbsp; Because otherwise, we're going to be selling the American 
		people a bill of goods.&nbsp; I mean, the easiest thing for me to do on the 
		health care debate would have been to tell people that what you're going 
		to get is guaranteed health insurance, lower your costs, all the 
		insurance reforms; we're going to lower the costs of Medicare and 
		Medicaid and it won't cost anybody anything.&nbsp; That's great politics, 
		it's just not true.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So there's got to be some 
		test of realism in any of these proposals, mine included.&nbsp; I've got to 
		hold myself accountable, and guaranteed the American people will hold 
		themselves -- will hold me accountable if what I'm selling doesn't 
		actually deliver.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman Price:</font></b>&nbsp; Mr.

		are all the legislative proposals that were offered --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">

		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman Price:</font></b>&nbsp; And so, 
		rest assured the summary document you received is backed up by precisely 
		the kind of detailed legislation that Speaker Pelosi and your 
		administration have been busy ignoring for 12 months.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Well, Mike 
		-- well, hold on, hold on a second.&nbsp; No, no, no, no.&nbsp; Hold on a second, 
		guys.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, Mike, I've read 
		your legislation.&nbsp; I mean, I take a look at this stuff -- and the good 
		ideas we take.&nbsp; But here's -- here's the thing -- here's the thing that 
		I guess all of us have to be mindful of, it can't be all or nothing, one 
		way or the other.&nbsp; And what I mean by that is this:&nbsp; If we put together 
		a stimulus package in which a third of it are tax cuts that normally you 
		guys would support, and support for states and the unemployed, and 
		helping people stay on COBRA that your governors certainly would support 
		-- Democrat or a Republican; and then you've got some infrastructure, 
		and maybe there's some things in there that you don’t like in terms of 
		infrastructure, or you think the bill should have been $500 billion 
		instead of $700 billion or there's this provision or that provision that 
		you don't like.&nbsp; If there's uniform opposition because the Republican 
		caucus doesn't get 100 percent or 80 percent of what you want, then it's 
		going to be hard to get a deal done.&nbsp; That's because that's not how 
		democracy works.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So my hope would be that we 
		can look at some of these component parts of what we're doing and maybe 
		we break some of them up on different policy issues.&nbsp; So if the good 
		congressman from Utah has a particular issue on lobbying reform that he 
		wants to work with us on, we may not able to agree on a comprehensive 
		package on everything but there may be some component parts that we can 
		work on.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You may not support our 
		overall jobs package, but if you look at the tax credit that we're 
		proposing for small businesses right now, it is consistent with a lot of 
		what you guys have said in the past.&nbsp; And just the fact that it's my 
		administration that's proposing it shouldn't prevent you from supporting 
		it.&nbsp; That's my point.</font></p>

		took on some very controversial subjects -- death penalty reform -- you 
		and I --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">

		negotiated on.&nbsp; You took on ethics reform.&nbsp; You took on some big 
		things.&nbsp; One of the keys was you rolled your sleeves up, you worked with 
		the other party, and ultimately you were able to make the deal.&nbsp; Now, 
		here's an observation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over the past year, in my 
		view, that attribute hasn't been in full bloom.&nbsp; And by that I mean, 
		you've gotten this subtext of House Republicans that sincerely want to 
		come and be a part of this national conversation toward solutions, but 
		they've really been stiff-armed by Speaker Pelosi.&nbsp; Now, I know you're 
		not in charge of that chamber, but there really is this dynamic of, 
		frankly, being shut out.&nbsp; When John Boehner and Eric Cantor presented 
		last February to you some substantive job creation, our stimulus 
		alternative, the attack machine began to marginalize Eric -- and we can 
		all look at the articles -- as &quot;Mr. No,&quot; and there was this pretty dark 
		story, ultimately, that wasn't productive and wasn't within this sort of 
		framework that you're articulating today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So here's the question.&nbsp; 
		Moving forward, I think all of us want to hit the reset button on 2009.&nbsp; 
		How do we move forward?&nbsp; And on the job creation piece in particular, 
		you mentioned Colombia, you mentioned Panama, you mentioned South 
		Korea.&nbsp; Are you willing to work with us, for example, to make sure those 
		FTAs get called, that's no-cost job creation?&nbsp; And ultimately, as you're 
		interacting with world leaders, that's got to put more arrows in your 
		quiver, and that's a very, very powerful tool for us.&nbsp; But the obstacle 
		is, frankly, the politics within the Democratic caucus?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Well, first 
		of all, Peter and I did work together effectively on a whole host of 
		issues.&nbsp; One of our former colleagues is right now running for governor, 
		on the Republican side, in Illinois.&nbsp; In the Republican primary, of 
		course, they're running ads of him saying nice things about me.&nbsp; Poor 
		guy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Although that's one of the 
		points that I made earlier.&nbsp; I mean, we've got to be careful about what 
		we say about each other sometimes, because it boxes us in in ways that 
		makes it difficult for us to work together, because our constituents 
		start believing us.&nbsp; They don't know sometimes this is just politics 
		what you guys -- or folks on my side do sometimes.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So just a tone of civility 
		instead of slash and burn would be helpful.&nbsp; The problem we have 
		sometimes is a media that responds only to slash-and-burn-style 
		politics.&nbsp; You don't get a lot of credit if I say, &quot;You know, I think 
		Paul Ryan is a pretty sincere guy and has a beautiful family.&quot;&nbsp; Nobody 
		is going to run that in the newspapers.</font></p>

		I think, a failure on my part, is to try to foster better communications 
		even if there's disagreement.&nbsp; And I will try to see if we can do more 
		of that this year.&nbsp; That's on the sort of the general issue.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the specific issue of 
		trade, you're right, there are conflicts within and fissures within the 
		Democratic Party.&nbsp; I suspect there are probably going to be some 
		fissures within the Republican Party, as well.&nbsp; I mean, you know, if you 
		went to some of your constituencies, they'd be pretty suspicious about 
		it, new trade agreements, because the suspicion is somehow they're all 
		one way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So part of what we've been 
		trying to do is to make sure that we're getting the enforcement side of 
		this tight, make sure that if we've got a trade agreement with China or 
		other countries, that they are abiding with it -- they're not stealing 
		our intellectual property or making sure that their non-tariff barriers 
		are lowered even as ours are opened up.&nbsp; And my hope is, is that we can 
		move forward with some of these trade agreements having built some 
		confidence -- not just among particular constituency groups, but among 
		the American people -- that trade is going to be reciprocal; that it's 
		not just going to be a one-way street.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You are absolutely right 
		though, Peter, when you say, for example, South Korea is a great ally of 
		ours.&nbsp; I mean, when I visited there, there is no country that is more 
		committed to friendship on a whole range of fronts than South Korea.&nbsp; 
		What is also true is that the European Union is about to sign a trade 
		agreement with South Korea, which means right at the moment when they 
		start opening up their markets, the Europeans might get in there before 
		we do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we've got to make sure 
		that we seize these opportunities.&nbsp; I will be talking more about trade 
		this year.&nbsp; It's going to have to be trade that combines opening their 
		markets with an enforcement mechanism, as well as just opening up our 
		markets.&nbsp; I think that's something that all of us would agree on.&nbsp; Let's 
		see if we can execute it over the next several years.&nbsp; All right, is 
		that it?</font></p>

		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman Hensarling:</font></b>&nbsp; I'm 
		doing well.&nbsp; Mr. President, a year ago I had an opportunity to speak to 
		you about the national debt.&nbsp; And something that you and I have in 
		common is we both have small children.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Absolutely.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman Hensarling:</font></b>&nbsp; And 
		I left that conversation really feeling your sincere commitment to 
		ensuring that our children, our nation's children, do not inherit an 
		unconscionable debt.&nbsp; We know that under current law, that government -- 
		the cost of government is due to grow from 20 percent of our economy to 
		40 percent of our economy, right about the time our children are leaving 
		college and getting that first job.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, shortly after 
		that conversation a year ago, the Republicans proposed a budget that 
		ensured that government did not grow beyond the historical standard of 
		20 percent of GDP.&nbsp; It was a budget that actually froze immediately 
		non-defense discretionary spending.&nbsp; It spent $5 trillion less than 
		ultimately what was enacted into law, and unfortunately, I believe that 
		budget was ignored.&nbsp; And since that budget was ignored, what were the 
		old annual deficits under Republicans have now become the monthly 
		deficits under Democrats.&nbsp; The national debt has increased 30 percent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, Mr. President, I know 
		you believe -- and I understand the argument, and I respect the view 
		that the spending is necessary due to the recession; many of us believe, 
		frankly, it's part of the problem, not part of the solution.&nbsp; But I 
		understand and I respect your view.&nbsp; But this is what I don't 
		understand, Mr. President.&nbsp; After that discussion, your administration 
		proposed a budget that would triple the national debt over the next 10 
		years -- surely you don't believe 10 years from now we will still be 
		mired in this recession -- and propose new entitlement spending and move 
		the cost of government to almost 24.5 percent of the economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, very soon, Mr. 
		President, you're due to submit a new budget.&nbsp; And my question is --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Jeb, I know 
		there's a question in there somewhere, because you're making a whole 
		bunch of assertions, half of which I disagree with, and I'm having to 
		sit here listening to them.&nbsp; At some point I know you're going to let me 
		answer.&nbsp; All right.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman Hensarling:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		That's the question.&nbsp; You are soon to submit a new budget, Mr. 
		President.&nbsp; Will that new budget, like your old budget, triple the 
		national debt and continue to take us down the path of increasing the 
		cost of government to almost 25 percent of our economy?&nbsp; That's the 
		question, Mr. President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Jeb, with 
		all due respect, I've just got to take this last question as an example 
		of how it's very hard to have the kind of bipartisan work that we're 
		going to do, because the whole question was structured as a talking 
		point for running a campaign.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, look, let's talk about 
		the budget once again, because I'll go through it with you line by 
		line.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is, is that when we came into office, the 
		deficit was $1.3 trillion -- $1.3 [trillion.]&nbsp; So when you say that 
		suddenly I've got a monthly budget that is higher than the -- a monthly 
		deficit that's higher than the annual deficit left by the Republicans, 
		that's factually just not true, and you know it's not true.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And what is true is that we 
		came in already with a $1.3 trillion deficit before I had passed any 
		law.&nbsp; What is true is we came in with $8 trillion worth of debt over the 
		next decade -- had nothing to do with anything that we had done.&nbsp; It had 
		to do with the fact that in 2000 when there was a budget surplus of $200 
		billion, you had a Republican administration and a Republican Congress, 
		and we had two tax cuts that weren't paid for.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You had a prescription 
		drug plan -- the biggest entitlement plan, by the way, in several 
		decades -- that was passed without it being paid for.&nbsp; You had two wars 
		that were done through supplementals.&nbsp; And then you had $3 trillion 
		projected because of the lost revenue of this recession.&nbsp; That's $8 
		trillion.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we increased it by a 
		trillion dollars because of the spending that we had to make on the 
		stimulus.&nbsp; I am happy to have any independent fact-checker out there 
		take a look at your presentation versus mine in terms of the accuracy of 
		what I just said.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, going forward, here's 
		the deal.&nbsp; I think, Paul, for example, head of the budget committee, has 
		looked at the budget and has made a serious proposal.&nbsp; I've read it.&nbsp; I 
		can tell you what's in it.&nbsp; And there are some ideas in there that I 
		would agree with, but there are some ideas that we should have a healthy 
		debate about because I don't agree with them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The major driver of our 
		long-term liabilities, everybody here knows, is Medicare and Medicaid 
		and our health care spending.&nbsp; Nothing comes close.&nbsp; Social Security we 
		could probably fix the same way Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan sat down 
		together and they could figure something out.&nbsp; That is manageable.&nbsp; 
		Medicare and Medicaid -- massive problem down the road.&nbsp; That's where -- 
		that's going to be what our children have to worry about.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, Paul's approach -- and 
		I want to be careful not simplifying this, because I know you've got a 
		lot of detail in your plan -- but if I understand it correctly, would 
		say we're going to provide vouchers of some sort for current Medicare 
		recipients at the current level --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman 
		Ryan:</font></b>&nbsp; No.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; No?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman 
		Ryan:</font></b>&nbsp; People 55 
		and above --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; Fifty-five 
		and -- well, no, I understand.&nbsp; I mean, there's a grandfathering in, but 
		just for future beneficiaries, right?&nbsp; That's why I said I didn't want 
		to -- I want to make sure that I'm not being unfair to your proposal, 
		but I just want to point out that I've read it.&nbsp; And the basic idea 
		would be that at some point we hold Medicare cost per recipient constant 
		as a way of making sure that that doesn't go way out of whack, and I'm 
		sure there are some details that --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman 
		Ryan:</font></b>&nbsp; We drew 
		it as a blend of inflation and health inflation, the point of our plan 
		is -- because Medicare, as you know, is a $38 trillion unfunded 
		liability -- it has to be reform for younger generations because it 
		won't exist because it's going bankrupt.&nbsp; And the premise of our idea 
		is, look, why not give people the same kind of health care plan we here 
		have in Congress?&nbsp; That's the kind of reform we're proposing for 
		Medicare.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; No, I 
		understand.&nbsp; Right, right.&nbsp; Well, look, as I said before, this is an 
		entirely legitimate proposal.&nbsp; The problem is twofold:&nbsp; One is that 
		depending on how it's structured, if recipients are suddenly getting a 
		plan that has their reimbursement rates going like this, but health care 
		costs are still going up like that, then over time the way we're saving 
		money is essentially by capping what they're getting relative to their 
		costs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I just want to point 
		out -- and this brings me to the second problem -- when we made a very 
		modest proposal as part of our package, our health care reform package, 
		to eliminate the subsidies going to insurance companies for Medicare 
		Advantage, we were attacked across the board, by many on your aisle, for 
		slashing Medicare.&nbsp; You remember?&nbsp; We're going to start cutting benefits 
		for seniors.&nbsp; That was the story that was perpetrated out there -- 
		scared the dickens out of a lot of seniors.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">
<img border="1" src="../../images/gopobama3.jpg" width="255" height="143">
No, no, but here's my 
		point.&nbsp; If the main question is going to be what do we do about Medicare 
		costs, any proposal that Paul makes will be painted, factually, from the 
		perspective of those who disagree with it, as cutting benefits over the 
		long term.&nbsp; Paul, I don't think you disagree with that, that there is a 
		political vulnerability to doing anything that tinkers with Medicare.&nbsp; 
		And that's probably the biggest savings that are obtained through Paul's 
		plan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I raise that not because 
		we shouldn't have a series discussion about it.&nbsp; I raise that because 
		we're not going to be able to do anything about any of these 
		entitlements if what we do is characterized, whatever proposals are put 
		out there, as, well, you know, that's -- the other party is being 
		irresponsible; the other party is trying to hurt our senior citizens; 
		that the other party is doing X, Y, Z.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why I say if we're 
		going to frame these debates in ways that allow us to solve them, then 
		we can't start off by figuring out, A, who's to blame; B, how can we 
		make the American people afraid of the other side.&nbsp; And unfortunately, 
		that's how our politics works right now.&nbsp; And that's how a lot of our 
		discussion works.&nbsp; That's how we start off -- every time somebody speaks 
		in Congress, the first thing they do, they stand up and all the talking 
		points -- I see Frank Luntz up here sitting in the front.&nbsp; He's already 
		polled it, and he said, you know, the way you're really going to -- I've 
		done a focus group and the way we're going to really box in Obama on 
		this one or make Pelosi look bad on that one -- I know, I like Frank, 
		we've had conversations between Frank and I.&nbsp; But that's how we 
		operate.&nbsp; It's all tactics, and it's not solving problems.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so the question is, at 
		what point can we have a serious conversation about Medicare and its 
		long-term liability, or a serious question about -- a serious 
		conversation about Social Security, or a serious conversation about 
		budget and debt in which we're not simply trying to position ourselves 
		politically.&nbsp; That's what I'm committed to doing.&nbsp; We won't agree all 
		the time in getting it done, but I'm committed to doing it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Congressman 
		Pence:</font></b>&nbsp; Take one 
		more?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#000048">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; You know, 
		I've already gone over time.&nbsp; But I'll be happy to take your question,
