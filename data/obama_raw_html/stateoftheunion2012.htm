<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, 

members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:</font></p>

<p align="left">

<img border="1" src="../images/barackobamaandrewsafbiraqwarend.jpg" width="256" height="171">

<font size="2" face="Arial">Last month, I went to Andrews Air 

Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq.&nbsp;Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a 

million of our fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We gather tonight knowing that this 

generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around 

the world.&nbsp;For the first time in nine years, there are no 

Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, 

<a href="barackobama/barackobamaosamabinladendeath.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country</font></a>.&nbsp;Most of al 

Qaeda’s top lieutenants have been defeated.&nbsp; The Taliban’s momentum has been 

broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">These achievements are a testament 

to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America’s Armed Forces.&nbsp;At a time 

when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all 

expectations.&nbsp;They’re not consumed with personal ambition.&nbsp; They don’t obsess 

over their differences.&nbsp;They focus on the mission at hand.&nbsp;They work 

together.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Imagine what we could accomplish if 

we followed their example.&nbsp;Think about the America within our 

reach:&nbsp;a country that leads the world in educating its people; an America that 

attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs; a 

future where we’re in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity 

aren’t so tied to unstable parts of the world; an economy built to last, where 

hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We can do this. I know we can, 

because we’ve done it before.&nbsp;At the end of World War II, when another 

generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy 

and middle class the world has ever known.&nbsp;My grandfather, a 

veteran of <a href="../MovieSpeeches/moviespeechpatton3rdarmyaddress.html">

<font color="#0000FF">Patton’s Army</font></a>, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My 

grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that 

turned out the best products on Earth.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a 

depression and fascism.&nbsp;They understood they were part of something larger; 

that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a 

chance to share -- the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could 

do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put 

a little away for retirement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The defining issue of our time is 

how to keep that promise alive.&nbsp;No challenge is more urgent.&nbsp;No debate is more 

important.&nbsp;We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of 

people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we 

can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their 

fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.&nbsp;What’s at 

stake aren’t Democratic values or Republican values, but American values.&nbsp;And 

we have to reclaim them.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Let’s remember how we got here.&nbsp;Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.&nbsp;Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete.&nbsp;Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking 

Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren’t, and 

personal debt that kept piling up.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In 2008, the house of cards 

collapsed.&nbsp;We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn’t 

afford or understand them.&nbsp;Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other 

people’s money.&nbsp;Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the 

authority to stop the bad behavior.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It was wrong.&nbsp;It was 

irresponsible.&nbsp;And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out 

of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans 

holding the bag.&nbsp;In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 

million jobs.&nbsp;And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full 

effect.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Those are the facts.&nbsp;But so are 

these:&nbsp;In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million 

jobs.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Last year, they created the most 

jobs since 2005.&nbsp;American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the 

first time since the late 1990s.&nbsp;Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by 

more than 2 trillion dollars.&nbsp;And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street 

accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The state of our Union is getting 

stronger.&nbsp;And we’ve come too far to turn back now.&nbsp; As long as I’m President, I 

will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum.&nbsp;But I intend 

to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the 

very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">No, we will not go back to an 

economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits.&nbsp;Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for 

an economy that’s built to last -- an economy built on American manufacturing, 

American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, this blueprint begins with 

American manufacturing.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">On the day I took office, our auto 

industry was on the verge of collapse.&nbsp;Some even said we should let it die.&nbsp;With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen.&nbsp; In exchange for 

help, we demanded responsibility.&nbsp;We got workers and automakers to settle their 

differences.&nbsp;We got the industry to retool and restructure.&nbsp;Today, General 

Motors is back on top as the world’s number-one automaker.&nbsp;Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company.&nbsp;Ford is 

investing billions in U.S. plants and factories.&nbsp;And together, the entire 

industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We bet on American workers.&nbsp;We bet 

on American ingenuity.&nbsp;And tonight, the American auto industry is back.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">What’s happening in Detroit can 

happen in other industries.&nbsp;It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and 

Raleigh.&nbsp;We can’t bring every job back that’s left our shore.&nbsp;But right now, 

it’s getting more expensive to do business in places like China.&nbsp; Meanwhile, 

America is more productive.&nbsp;A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me 

that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home.&nbsp;Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock’s unionized plant in 

Milwaukee is running at full capacity.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So we have a huge opportunity, at 

this moment, to bring manufacturing back.&nbsp;But we have to seize it.&nbsp;Tonight, my 

message to business leaders is simple:&nbsp;Ask yourselves what you can do to bring 

jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help 

you succeed.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We should start with our tax code.&nbsp;Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas.&nbsp;Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the 

highest tax rates in the world.&nbsp;It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.&nbsp;So 

let’s change it.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">First, if you’re a business that 

wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a tax deduction for doing it.&nbsp;That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master 

Lock that decide to bring jobs home.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Second, no American company should 

be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits 

overseas.&nbsp;From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a 

basic minimum tax.&nbsp;And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for 

companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Third, if you’re an American 

manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut.&nbsp;If you’re a high-tech 

manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your 

products here.&nbsp;And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard 

when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, 

or training for new workers.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So my message is simple.&nbsp;It is time 

to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding 

companies that create jobs right here in America.&nbsp; Send me these tax reforms, 

and I will sign them right away.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We’re also making it easier for 

American businesses to sell products all over the world.&nbsp;Two years ago, I set a 

goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.&nbsp;With the bipartisan trade 

agreements we signed into law, we’re on track to meet that goal ahead of 

schedule.&nbsp;And soon, there will be millions of new customers for 

American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.&nbsp;Soon, there will be new 

cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I will go anywhere in the world to 

open new markets for American products.&nbsp;And I will not stand by when our 

competitors don’t play by the rules.&nbsp;We’ve brought trade cases against China at 

nearly twice the rate as the last Administration -- and it’s made a difference.&nbsp;Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a 

surge in Chinese tires.&nbsp;But we need to do more.&nbsp;It’s not right when another 

country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated.&nbsp;It’s not fair when 

foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they’re heavily 

subsidized.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Tonight, I’m announcing the creation 

of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair 

trading practices in countries like China.&nbsp;There will be more 

inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.&nbsp;And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over 

American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like 

Russia.&nbsp;Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field 

is level, I promise you -- America will always win.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I also hear from many business 

leaders who want to hire in the United States but can’t find workers with the 

right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many 

openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that -- openings at 

a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.&nbsp;It’s inexcusable.&nbsp;And 

we know how to fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Jackie Bray is a single mom from 

North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic.&nbsp;Then Siemens opened 

a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central 

Piedmont Community College.&nbsp;The company helped the college design courses in 

laser and robotics training. It paid Jackie’s tuition, then hired her to help 

operate their plant.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I want every American looking for 

work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did.&nbsp; Join me in a national 

commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a 

job.&nbsp;My Administration has already lined up more companies that 

want to help.&nbsp;Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community 

colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and 

running.&nbsp; Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need 

to become community career centers -- places that teach people skills that 

businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech 

manufacturing.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And I want to cut through the maze 

of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one 

program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help that 

they need.&nbsp; It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment 

system that puts people to work.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today.&nbsp;But to prepare for 

the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start 

earlier.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For less than 1 percent of what our 

nation spends on education each year, we’ve convinced nearly every state in the 

country to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the first time 

that’s happened in a generation.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But challenges remain.&nbsp;And we know 

how to solve them.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">At a time when other countries are 

doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off 

thousands of teachers.&nbsp;We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income 

of a classroom by over 250,000 dollars.&nbsp;A great teacher can offer an escape from 

poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.&nbsp;Every person in this 

chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives.&nbsp;Most 

teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own 

pocket for school supplies -- just to make a difference.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Teachers matter.&nbsp;So instead of 

bashing them, or defending the status quo, let’s offer schools a deal.&nbsp;Give 

them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. 

And in return, grant schools flexibility:&nbsp;to teach with creativity 

and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just 

aren’t helping kids learn.&nbsp;That’s a bargain worth making.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We also know that when students 

don’t walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their 

diploma.&nbsp;When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better.&nbsp;So 

tonight, I am proposing that every state -- every state -- requires that all 

students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When kids do graduate, the most 

daunting challenge can be the cost of college.&nbsp;At a time when Americans owe 

more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the 

interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Extend the tuition tax credit we 

started that saves millions of middle-class families thousands of dollars, and 

give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling 

the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course, it’s not enough for us to 

increase student aid.&nbsp;We can’t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; 

we’ll run out of money.&nbsp;States also need to do their part, by making higher 

education a higher priority in their budgets.&nbsp;And colleges and universities 

have to do their part by working to keep costs down.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Recently, I spoke with a group of 

college presidents who’ve done just that.&nbsp;Some schools redesign courses to help 

students finish more quickly.&nbsp;Some use better technology.&nbsp;The point is, it’s 

possible.&nbsp;So let me put colleges and universities on notice:&nbsp;If you can’t stop 

tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down.&nbsp;Higher education can’t be a luxury 

-- it is an economic imperative 

that every family in America should be able to afford.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Let’s also remember that hundreds of 

thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another 

challenge:&nbsp;the fact that they aren’t yet American citizens.&nbsp; Many were brought 

here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every 

day with the threat of deportation.&nbsp;Others came more recently, to study 

business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we 

send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That doesn’t make sense.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I believe as strongly as ever that 

we should take on illegal immigration.&nbsp;That’s why my Administration has put 

more boots on the border than ever before.&nbsp;That’s why there are fewer illegal 

crossings than when I took office.&nbsp;The opponents of action are out of excuses.&nbsp;We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But if election-year politics keeps 

Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let’s at least agree to stop 

expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new 

businesses, defend this country.&nbsp;Send me a law that gives them the chance to 

earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away.</font></p>

<p align="left">

<img border="1" src="../images/barackobama2012sou2.jpg" width="391" height="260"></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You see, an economy built to last is 

one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this 

country.&nbsp;That means women should earn equal pay for equal work.&nbsp;It means we should support everyone who’s willing to work, and every risk-taker 

and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After all, innovation is what 

America has always been about.&nbsp;Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small 

businesses.&nbsp;So let’s pass an agenda that helps them succeed.&nbsp;Tear down 

regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to 

grow.&nbsp;Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages 

and creating good jobs.&nbsp;Both parties agree on these ideas.&nbsp;So put them in a 

bill, and get it on my desk this year.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Innovation also demands basic 

research.&nbsp; Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs 

and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave 

healthy ones untouched.&nbsp; New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can 

stop any bullet.&nbsp; Don’t gut these investments in our budget.&nbsp; Don’t let other 

countries win the race for the future.&nbsp; Support the same kind of research and 

innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs 

and new American industries.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And nowhere is the promise of 

innovation greater than in American-made energy.&nbsp; Over the last three years, 

we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m 

directing my Administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential 

offshore oil and gas resources.&nbsp;Right now -- right now -- American 

oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years.&nbsp; That’s right -- 

eight years.&nbsp; Not only that -- last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in 

any of the past 16 years.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But with only 2 percent of the 

world’s oil reserves, oil isn’t enough.&nbsp; This country needs an all-out, 

all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American 

energy.&nbsp;A strategy that’s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We have a supply of natural gas that 

can last America nearly 100 years.&nbsp;And my Administration will take 

every possible action to safely develop this energy.&nbsp; Experts believe this will 

support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade.&nbsp; And I’m requiring all 

companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they 

use.&nbsp;Because America will develop this resource without putting 

the health and safety of our citizens at risk.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The development of natural gas will 

create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving 

that we don’t have to choose between our environment and our economy.&nbsp;And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 

30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas 

out of shale rock –- reminding us that government support is critical in helping 

businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, what’s true for natural gas is 

just as true for clean energy.&nbsp; In three years, our partnership with the private 

sector has already positioned America to be the world’s leading manufacturer of 

high-tech batteries.&nbsp; Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has 

nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When 

<a href="http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/01/energetx_worker_invited_to_sta.html">

<font color="#0000FF">Bryan Ritterby</font></a> was laid off 

from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give 

him a second chance.&nbsp; But he found work at 

<a href="https://www.energetxcomposites.com/"><font color="#0000FF">Energetx,</font></a> a wind turbine manufacturer 

in Michigan.&nbsp; Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.&nbsp; Today, 

it’s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, “I’m proud to be working in the 

industry of the future.”</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Our experience with shale gas, our 

experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public 

investments don’t always come right away.&nbsp; Some technologies don’t pan out; some 

companies fail.&nbsp; But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.&nbsp; I 

will not walk away from workers like Bryan.&nbsp;I will not cede the 

wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make 

the same commitment here.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We’ve subsidized oil companies for a 

century.&nbsp; That’s long enough.&nbsp;It’s time to end the taxpayer 

giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down 

on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising.&nbsp; Pass clean 

energy tax credits.&nbsp; Create these jobs.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We can also spur energy innovation 

with new incentives.&nbsp; The differences in this chamber may be too deep right 

now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.&nbsp; But there’s no 

reason why Congress shouldn’t at least set a clean energy standard that creates 

a market for innovation.&nbsp; So far, you haven’t acted.&nbsp; Well, tonight, I 

will.&nbsp; I’m directing my Administration to allow the development of clean 

energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes.&nbsp; And I’m proud to 

announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world’s largest 

consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in 

history -- with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a 

million homes a year.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course, the easiest way to save 

money is to waste less energy.&nbsp; So here’s a proposal:&nbsp;Help manufacturers 

eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to 

upgrade their buildings.&nbsp; Their energy bills will be 100 billion dollars lower over the 

next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs 

for construction workers who need them.&nbsp; Send me a bill that creates these 

jobs.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Building this new energy future 

should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure.&nbsp; 

So much of America needs to be rebuilt.&nbsp; We’ve got crumbling roads and bridges; 

a power grid that wastes too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband 

network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her 

products all over the world.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">During the Great Depression, America 

built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge.&nbsp; After World War II, we 

connected our states with a system of highways.&nbsp; Democratic and Republican 

Administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the 

workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the next few weeks, I will sign 

an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many 

construction projects.&nbsp; But you need to fund these projects.&nbsp; Take the money 

we’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use 

the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There’s never been a better time to 

build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit 

when the housing bubble burst.&nbsp; Of course, construction workers weren’t the only 

ones who were hurt.&nbsp; So were millions of innocent Americans who’ve seen their 

home values decline.&nbsp; And while government can’t fix the problem on its own, 

responsible homeowners shouldn’t have to sit and wait for the housing market to 

hit bottom to get some relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And that’s why I’m sending this 

Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about 

3,000 dollars a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.&nbsp;No more red tape.&nbsp; No more runaround from the banks.&nbsp; A small fee 

on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won’t add to the 

deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to 

repay a deficit of trust.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Let’s never forget:&nbsp;Millions of 

Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and 

a financial system that do the same.&nbsp;It’s time to apply the same rules from top 

to bottom.&nbsp;No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts.&nbsp;An America built to last 

insists on responsibility from everybody.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We’ve all paid the price for lenders 

who sold mortgages to people who couldn’t afford them, and buyers who knew they 

couldn’t afford them.&nbsp; That’s why we need smart regulations to prevent 

irresponsible behavior.&nbsp;Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic 

dumping or faulty medical devices -- these don’t destroy the free market.&nbsp; They 

make the free market work better.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There’s no question that some 

regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly.&nbsp; In fact, I’ve approved 

fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican 

predecessor did in his.&nbsp;I’ve ordered every federal agency to 

eliminate rules that don’t make sense.&nbsp; We’ve already announced over 500 

reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than 10 billion 

dollars over the next five years.&nbsp; We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago 

that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend 10,000 dollars a year proving that 

they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.&nbsp; 

With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, I’m confident a farmer can 

contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder.&nbsp;Absolutely.&nbsp; But I will not back down from making sure an oil 

company can contain the kind of oil spill 

<a href="barackobama/barackobamabpoilspillovaloffice.htm"><font color="#0000FF">we saw in the Gulf two years ago</font></a>.&nbsp; 

I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury 

poisoning, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean.&nbsp; I will 

not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to 

cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And I will not go back to the days 

when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules.&nbsp; The new rules we 

passed restore what should be any financial system’s core purpose:&nbsp; Getting 

funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible 

families who want to buy a home, or start a business, or send their kids to 

college.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So if you are a big bank or 

financial institution, you’re no longer allowed to make risky bets with your 

customers’ deposits.&nbsp; You’re required to write out a “living will” that details 

exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you fail -- because the rest of us are not 

bailing you out ever again.&nbsp; And if you’re a mortgage lender or a 

payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for 

products they can’t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those 

days are over.&nbsp; Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cordray"><font color="#0000FF">Richard Cordray</font></a> with one job:&nbsp;to look out for them.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We’ll also establish a Financial 

Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud 

and protect people’s investments.&nbsp; Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud 

laws because there’s no real penalty for being a repeat offender.&nbsp; That’s bad 

for consumers, and it’s bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial 

service professionals who do the right thing.&nbsp; So pass legislation that makes 

the penalties for fraud count.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And tonight, I’m asking my Attorney 

General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state 

attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and 

packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis.&nbsp; This 

new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to 

homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many 

Americans.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, a return to the American values 

of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our 

economy.&nbsp; But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest 

in our future.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Right now, our most immediate 

priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the 

recovery is still fragile.&nbsp;People cannot afford losing 40 dollars out of 

each paycheck this year.&nbsp; There are plenty of ways to get this done.&nbsp; So let’s 

agree right here, right now:&nbsp; No side issues.&nbsp; No drama.&nbsp; Pass the payroll tax 

cut without delay.&nbsp; Let’s get it done.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">When it comes to the deficit, we’ve 

already agreed to more than 2 trillion dollars in cuts and savings.&nbsp;But we need to do 

more, and that means making choices.&nbsp; Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly 1 

trillion dollars more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the 

wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.&nbsp; Right now, because of loopholes and shelters 

in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions 

of middle-class households.&nbsp; Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate 

than his secretary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Do we want to keep these tax cuts 

for the wealthiest Americans?&nbsp; Or do we want to keep our investments in 

everything else -- like education and medical research; a strong military and 

care for our veterans?&nbsp; Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, we 

can’t do both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The American people know what the 

right choice is.&nbsp; So do I.&nbsp; As I told the Speaker this summer, I’m prepared to 

make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and 

strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of 

security for seniors.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But in return, we need to change our 

tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress, pay 

our fair share of taxes.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Tax reform should follow the Buffett 

Rule.&nbsp;If you make more than 1 million dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30 

percent in taxes.&nbsp;And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right:&nbsp;Washington 

should stop subsidizing millionaires.&nbsp;In fact, if you’re earning a million 

dollars a year, you shouldn’t get special tax subsidies or deductions.&nbsp;On the 

other hand, if you make under 250,000 dollars a year, like 98 percent of American 

families, your taxes shouldn’t go up.&nbsp;You’re the ones struggling 

with rising costs and stagnant wages.&nbsp;You’re the ones who need relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, you can call this class warfare 

all you want.&nbsp;But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary 

in taxes?&nbsp;Most Americans would call that common sense.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We don’t begrudge financial success 

in this country.&nbsp; We admire it.&nbsp; When Americans talk about folks like me paying 

my fair share of taxes, it’s not because they envy the rich.&nbsp; It’s because they 

understand that when I get a tax break I don’t need and the country can’t 

afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the 

difference -- like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get 

through school, or a family trying to make ends meet.&nbsp; That’s not right.&nbsp; 

Americans know that’s not right.&nbsp; They know that this generation’s success is 

only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and 

to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure 

if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility.&nbsp; That’s how we’ll reduce 

our deficit.&nbsp; That’s an America built to last.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, I recognize that people 

watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health 

care.&nbsp; But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are 

thinking the same thing right about now:&nbsp; Nothing will get done in Washington 

this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington 

is broken.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Can you blame them for feeling a 

little cynical?&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The greatest blow to our confidence 

in our economy last year didn’t come from events beyond our control.&nbsp; It came 

from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills 

or not.&nbsp; Who benefited from that fiasco?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I’ve talked tonight about the 

deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.&nbsp; But the divide between 

this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad -- and it seems to get 

worse every year.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of this has to do with the 

corrosive influence of money in politics.&nbsp; So together, let’s take some steps to 

fix that.&nbsp; Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress; I 

will sign it tomorrow.&nbsp; Let’s limit any elected official from 

owning stocks in industries they impact.&nbsp; Let’s make sure people who bundle 

campaign contributions for Congress can’t lobby Congress, and vice versa -- an 

idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some of what’s broken has to do with 

the way Congress does its business these days.&nbsp; A simple majority is no longer 

enough to get anything -- even routine business -- passed through the Senate.&nbsp; 

Neither party has been blameless in these tactics.&nbsp; Now both 

parties should put an end to it.&nbsp;For starters, I ask the Senate to 

pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a 

simple up or down vote within 90 days.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The executive branch also needs to 

change.&nbsp; Too often, it’s inefficient, outdated and remote.&nbsp;That’s 

why I’ve asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the 

federal bureaucracy, so that our government is leaner, quicker, and more 

responsive to the needs of the American people.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally, none of this can happen 

unless we also lower the temperature in this town.&nbsp; We need to end the notion 

that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual 

destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of 

building consensus around common-sense ideas.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I’m a Democrat.&nbsp; But I believe what 

Republican Abraham Lincoln believed:&nbsp; That government should do for people only 

what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.&nbsp;That’s why 

my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and 

states.&nbsp; That’s why we’re getting rid of regulations that don’t work.&nbsp; That’s 

why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a government 

program.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">On the other hand, even my 

Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have 

supported federally financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal 

offices for the folks back home.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The point is, we should all want a 

smarter, more effective government.&nbsp; And while we may not be able to bridge our 

biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress.&nbsp; With or 

without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow.&nbsp; 

But I can do a whole lot more with your help.&nbsp; Because when we act together, 

there’s nothing the United States of America can’t achieve.&nbsp; That’s 

the lesson we’ve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Ending the Iraq war has allowed us 

to strike decisive blows against our enemies.&nbsp; From Pakistan to Yemen, the 

al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can’t escape 

the reach of the United States of America.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">From this position of strength, 

we’ve begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan.&nbsp; Ten thousand of our troops 

have come home.&nbsp; Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this 

summer.&nbsp; This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an 

enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of 

attacks against America.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As the tide of war recedes, a wave 

of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to 

Cairo; from Sana’a to Tripoli.&nbsp; A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the world’s 

longest-serving dictators -- a murderer with American blood on his hands.&nbsp; 

Today, he is gone.&nbsp; And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will 

soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human 

dignity cannot be denied.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">How this incredible transformation 

will end remains uncertain.&nbsp; But we have a huge stake in the outcome.&nbsp; And while 

it’s ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will 

advocate for those values that have served our own country so well.&nbsp; We will 

stand against violence and intimidation.&nbsp; We will stand for the rights and 

dignity of all human beings -- men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.&nbsp; We 

will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open 

markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And we will safeguard America’s own 

security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our 

interests.&nbsp; Look at Iran.&nbsp; Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was 

once divided about how to deal with Iran’s nuclear program now stands as one.&nbsp; 

The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with 

crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this 

pressure will not relent.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Let there be no doubt:&nbsp; America is 

determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no 

options off the table to achieve that goal.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But a peaceful resolution of this 

issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets 

its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The renewal of American leadership 

can be felt across the globe.&nbsp; Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are 

stronger than ever.&nbsp; Our ties to the Americas are deeper.&nbsp; Our 

ironclad commitment -- and I mean ironclad -- to Israel’s security has meant the 

closest military cooperation between our two countries in history.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We’ve made it clear that America is 

a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope.&nbsp; From the 

coalitions we’ve built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we’ve led 

against hunger and disease; from the blows we’ve dealt to our enemies, to the 

enduring power of our moral example, America is back.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Anyone who tells you otherwise, 

anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, 

doesn’t know what they’re talking about.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That’s not the message we get from 

leaders around the world who are eager to work with us.&nbsp; That’s not how people 

feel from Tokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are 

higher than they’ve been in years.&nbsp; Yes, the world is changing.&nbsp; No, we can’t 

control every event.&nbsp; But America remains the one indispensable nation in world 

affairs -- and as long as I’m President, I intend to keep it that way.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That’s why, working with our 

military leaders, I’ve proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain 

the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in 

our budget.&nbsp; To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I’ve already sent this 

Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of 

cyber-threats.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Above all, our freedom endures 

because of the men and women in uniform who defend it.&nbsp;As they 

come home, we must serve them as well as they’ve served us.&nbsp; That includes 

giving them the care and the benefits they have earned -- which is why we’ve 

increased annual VA spending every year I’ve been President.&nbsp; And 

it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">With the bipartisan support of this 

Congress, we’re providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets.&nbsp; Michelle 

and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 

135,000 jobs for veterans and their families.&nbsp; And tonight, I’m proposing a 

Veterans Jobs Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and 

firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Which brings me back to where I 

began.&nbsp; Those of us who’ve been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from 

the service of our troops.&nbsp; When you put on that uniform, it doesn’t matter if 

you’re black or white; Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; 

rich, poor; gay, straight.&nbsp; When you’re marching into battle, you look out for 

the person next to you, or the mission fails.&nbsp; When you’re in the thick of the 

fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">One of my proudest possessions is 

the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden.&nbsp; On 

it are each of their names.&nbsp; Some may be Democrats.&nbsp; Some may be Republicans.&nbsp; 

But that doesn’t matter.&nbsp; Just like it didn’t matter that day in the Situation 

Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a man who was George Bush’s defense 

secretary -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman who ran against me for President.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All that mattered that day was the 

mission.&nbsp; No one thought about politics.&nbsp; No one thought about themselves.&nbsp; One 

of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn’t deserve 

credit for the mission.&nbsp; It only succeeded, he said, because every single member 

of that unit did their job -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out 

of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the 

troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who 

charged up the stairs.&nbsp; More than that, the mission only succeeded because every 

member of that unit trusted each other -- because you can’t charge up those 

stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there’s somebody behind 

you, watching your back.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So it is with America.&nbsp; Each time I 

look at that flag, I’m reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 

50 stars and those 13 stripes.&nbsp; No one built this country on their own.&nbsp; This 

nation is great because we built it together.&nbsp; This nation is great because we 

worked as a team.&nbsp; This nation is great because we get each other’s backs.&nbsp; And 

if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge 

too great; no mission too hard.&nbsp; As long as we are joined in common purpose, as 

long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our 

future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Thank you, God bless you, and God 

bless the United States of America.</font></p>
