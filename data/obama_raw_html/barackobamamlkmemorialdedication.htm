<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">An earthquake and a 
		hurricane may have delayed this day, but this is a day that would not be 
		denied.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For this day, we celebrate 
		Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s return to the National Mall.&nbsp; In this 
		place, he will stand for all time, among monuments to those who fathered 
		this nation and those who defended it; a black preacher with no official 
		rank or title who somehow gave voice to our deepest dreams and our most 
		lasting ideals, a man who stirred our conscience and thereby helped make 
		our union more perfect.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And Dr. King would be the 
		first to remind us that this memorial is not for him alone.&nbsp; The 
		movement of which he was a part depended on an entire generation of 
		leaders.&nbsp; Many are here today, and for their service and their 
		sacrifice, we owe them our everlasting gratitude.&nbsp; This is a monument to 
		your collective achievement.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some giants of the civil 
		rights movement -- like Rosa Parks and Dorothy Height, Benjamin Hooks, 
		Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth -- they’ve been taken from us these past few 
		years.&nbsp; This monument attests to their strength and their courage, and 
		while we miss them dearly, we know they rest in a better place.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, there are the 
		multitudes of men and women whose names never appear in the history 
		books -- those who marched and those who sang, those who sat in and 
		those who stood firm, those who organized and those who mobilized -- all 
		those men and women who through countless acts of quiet heroism helped 
		bring about changes few thought were even possible. “By the thousands,” 
		said Dr. King, “faceless, anonymous, relentless young people, black and 
		white…have taken our whole nation back to those great wells of democracy 
		which were dug deep by the founding fathers in the formulation of the 
		Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.”&nbsp; To those men and 
		women, to those foot soldiers for justice, know that this monument is 
		yours, as well.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nearly half a century has 
		passed since that historic March on Washington, a day when thousands 
		upon thousands gathered for jobs and for freedom.&nbsp; That is what our 
		schoolchildren remember best when they think of Dr. King -- his booming 
		voice across this Mall, calling on America to make freedom a reality for 
		all of God’s children, [prophesying] of a day when the jangling discord 
		of our nation would be transformed into a beautiful symphony of 
		brotherhood.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is right that we honor 
		that march, that we lift up Dr. King’s “<a href="../mlkihaveadream.htm"><font color="#0000FF">I Have a Dream” speech</font></a> -- for 
		without that shining moment, without Dr. King’s glorious words, we might 
		not have had the courage to come as far as we have.&nbsp; Because of that 
		hopeful vision, because of Dr. King’s moral imagination, barricades 
		began to fall and bigotry began to fade.&nbsp; New doors of opportunity swung 
		open for an entire generation.&nbsp; Yes, laws changed, but hearts and minds 
		changed, as well.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Look at the faces here 
		around you, and you see an America that is more fair and more free and 
		more just than the one Dr. King addressed that day.&nbsp; We are right to 
		savor that slow but certain progress -- progress that’s expressed itself 
		in a million ways, large and small, across this nation every single day, 
		as people of all colors and creeds live together, and work together, and 
		fight alongside one another, and learn together, and build together, and 
		love one another.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So it is right for us to 
		celebrate today Dr. King’s dream and his vision of unity.&nbsp; And yet it is 
		also important on this day to remind ourselves that such progress did 
		not come easily; that Dr. King’s faith was hard-won; that it sprung out 
		of a harsh reality and some bitter disappointments.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is right for us to 
		celebrate Dr. King’s marvelous oratory, but it is worth remembering that 
		progress did not come from words alone.&nbsp; Progress was hard.&nbsp; Progress 
		was purchased through enduring the smack of billy clubs and the blast of 
		fire hoses.&nbsp; It was bought with days in jail cells and nights of bomb 
		threats.&nbsp; For every victory during the height of the civil rights 
		movement, there were setbacks and there were defeats.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We forget now, but during 
		his life, Dr. King wasn’t always considered a unifying figure.&nbsp; Even 
		after rising to prominence, even after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, 
		Dr. King was vilified by many, denounced as a rabble rouser and an 
		agitator, a communist and a radical.&nbsp; He was even attacked by his own 
		people, by those who felt he was going too fast or those who felt he was 
		going too slow; by those who felt he shouldn’t meddle in issues like the 
		Vietnam War or the rights of union workers.&nbsp; We know from his own 
		testimony the doubts and the pain this caused him, and that the 
		controversy that would swirl around his actions would last until the 
		fateful day he died.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I raise all this because 
		nearly 50 years after the March on Washington, our work, Dr. King’s 
		work, is not yet complete.&nbsp; We gather here at a moment of great 
		challenge and great change.&nbsp; In the first decade of this new century, we 
		have been tested by war and by tragedy; by an economic crisis and its 
		aftermath that has left millions out of work, and poverty on the rise, 
		and millions more just struggling to get by.&nbsp; Indeed, even before this 
		crisis struck, we had endured a decade of rising inequality and stagnant 
		wages.&nbsp; In too many troubled neighborhoods across the country, the 
		conditions of our poorest citizens appear little changed from what 
		existed 50 years ago -- neighborhoods with underfunded schools and 
		broken-down slums, inadequate health care, constant violence, 
		neighborhoods in which too many young people grow up with little hope 
		and few prospects for the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our work is not done.&nbsp; And 
		so on this day, in which we celebrate a man and a movement that did so 
		much for this country, let us draw strength from those earlier 
		struggles.&nbsp; First and foremost, let us remember that change has never 
		been quick.&nbsp; Change has never been simple, or without controversy.&nbsp; 
		Change depends on persistence.&nbsp; Change requires determination.&nbsp; It took 
		a full decade before the moral guidance of Brown v. Board of Education 
		was translated into the enforcement measures of the Civil Rights Act and 
		the Voting Rights Act, but those 10 long years did not lead Dr. King to 
		give up.&nbsp; He kept on pushing, he kept on speaking, he kept on marching 
		until change finally came.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then when, even after 
		the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act passed, African Americans 
		still found themselves trapped in pockets of poverty across the country, 
		Dr. King didn’t say those laws were a failure; he didn’t say this is too 
		hard; he didn’t say, let’s settle for what we got and go home.&nbsp; Instead 
		he said, let’s take those victories and broaden our mission to achieve 
		not just civil and political equality but also economic justice; let’s 
		fight for a living wage and better schools and jobs for all who are 
		willing to work.&nbsp; In other words, when met with hardship, when 
		confronting disappointment, Dr. King refused to accept what he called 
		the “isness” of today.&nbsp; He kept pushing towards the “oughtness” of 
		tomorrow.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so, as we think about 
		all the work that we must do -- rebuilding an economy that can compete 
		on a global stage, and fixing our schools so that every child -- not 
		just some, but every child -- gets a world-class education, and making 
		sure that our health care system is affordable and accessible to all, 
		and that our economic system is one in which everybody gets a fair shake 
		and everybody does their fair share, let us not be trapped by what is.&nbsp; 
		We can’t be discouraged by what is.&nbsp; We’ve got to keep pushing for what 
		ought to be, the America we ought to leave to our children, mindful that 
		the hardships we face are nothing compared to those Dr. King and his 
		fellow marchers faced 50 years ago, and that if we maintain our faith, 
		in ourselves and in the possibilities of this nation, there is no 
		challenge we cannot surmount.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And just as we draw strength 
		from Dr. King’s struggles, so must we draw inspiration from his constant 
		insistence on the oneness of man; the belief in his words that “we are 
		caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment 
		of destiny.”&nbsp; It was that insistence, rooted in his Christian faith, 
		that led him to tell a group of angry young protesters, “I love you as I 
		love my own children,” even as one threw a rock that glanced off his 
		neck.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was that insistence, that 
		belief that God resides in each of us, from the high to the low, in the 
		oppressor and the oppressed, that convinced him that people and systems 
		could change.&nbsp; It fortified his belief in non-violence.&nbsp; It permitted 
		him to place his faith in a government that had fallen short of its 
		ideals.&nbsp; It led him to see his charge not only as freeing black America 
		from the shackles of discrimination, but also freeing many Americans 
		from their own prejudices, and freeing Americans of every color from the 
		depredations of poverty.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		And so at this moment, when our politics appear so sharply polarized, 
		and faith in our institutions so greatly diminished, we need more than 
		ever to take heed of Dr. King’s teachings.&nbsp; He calls on us to stand in 
		the other person’s shoes; to see through their eyes; to understand their 
		pain.&nbsp; He tells us that we have a duty to fight against poverty, even if 
		we are well off; to care about the child in the decrepit school even if 
		our own children are doing fine; to show compassion toward the immigrant 
		family, with the knowledge that most of us are only a few generations 
		removed from similar hardships.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To say that we are bound 
		together as one people, and must constantly strive to see ourselves in 
		one another, is not to argue for a false unity that papers over our 
		differences and ratifies an unjust status quo.&nbsp; As was true 50 years 
		ago, as has been true throughout human history, those with power and 
		privilege will often decry any call for change as “divisive.”&nbsp; They’ll 
		say any challenge to the existing arrangements are unwise and 
		destabilizing.&nbsp; Dr. King understood that peace without justice was no 
		peace at all; that aligning our reality with our ideals often requires 
		the speaking of uncomfortable truths and the creative tension of 
		non-violent protest.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But he also understood that 
		to bring about true and lasting change, there must be the possibility of 
		reconciliation; that any social movement has to channel this tension 
		through the spirit of love and mutuality.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If he were alive today, I 
		believe he would remind us that the unemployed worker can rightly 
		challenge the excesses of Wall Street without demonizing all who work 
		there; that the businessman can enter tough negotiations with his 
		company’s union without vilifying the right to collectively bargain.&nbsp; He 
		would want us to know we can argue fiercely about the proper size and 
		role of government without questioning each other’s love for this 
		country -- with the knowledge that in this democracy, government is no 
		distant object but is rather an expression of our common commitments to 
		one another.&nbsp; He would call on us to assume the best in each other 
		rather than the worst, and challenge one another in ways that ultimately 
		heal rather than wound.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end, that’s what I 
		hope my daughters take away from this monument.&nbsp; I want them to come 
		away from here with a faith in what they can accomplish when they are 
		determined and working for a righteous cause.&nbsp; I want them to come away 
		from here with a faith in other people and a faith in a benevolent God.&nbsp; 
		This sculpture, massive and iconic as it is, will remind them of Dr. 
		King’s strength, but to see him only as larger than life would do a 
		disservice to what he taught us about ourselves.&nbsp; He would want them to 
		know that he had setbacks, because they will have setbacks.&nbsp; He would 
		want them to know that he had doubts, because they will have doubts.&nbsp; He 
		would want them to know that he was flawed, because all of us have 
		flaws.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is precisely because Dr. 
		King was a man of flesh and blood and not a figure of stone that he 
		inspires us so.&nbsp; His life, his story, tells us that change can come if 
		you don’t give up.&nbsp; He would not give up, no matter how long it took, 
		because in the smallest hamlets and the darkest slums, he had witnessed 
		the highest reaches of the human spirit; because in those moments when 
		the struggle seemed most hopeless, he had seen men and women and 
		children conquer their fear; because he had seen hills and mountains 
		made low and rough places made plain, and the crooked places made 
		straight and God make a way out of no way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that is why we honor 
		this man -- because he had faith in us.&nbsp; And that is why he belongs on 
		this Mall -- because he saw what we might become.&nbsp; That is why Dr. King 
		was so quintessentially American -- because for all the hardships we’ve 
		endured, for all our sometimes tragic history, ours is a story of 
		optimism and achievement and constant striving that is unique upon this 
		Earth.&nbsp; And that is why the rest of the world still looks to us to 
		lead.&nbsp; This is a country where ordinary people find in their hearts the 
		courage to do extraordinary things; the courage to stand up in the face 
		of the fiercest resistance and despair and say this is wrong, and this 
		is right; we will not settle for what the cynics tell us we have to 
		accept and we will reach again and again, no matter the odds, for what 
		we know is possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is the conviction we 
		must carry now in our hearts.&nbsp; As tough as times may be, I know we will 
		overcome.&nbsp; I know there are better days ahead.&nbsp; I know this because of 
		the man towering over us.&nbsp; I know this because all he and his generation 
		endured -- we are here today in a country that dedicated a monument to 
		that legacy.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so with our eyes on the 
		horizon and our faith squarely placed in one another, let us keep 
		striving; let us keep struggling; let us keep climbing toward that 
		promised land of a nation and a world that is more fair, and more just, 
		and more equal for every single child of God.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, God bless you, 
		and God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
