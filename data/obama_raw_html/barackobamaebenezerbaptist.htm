		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">Scripture tells us 
		that when Joshua and the Israelites arrived at the gates of Jericho, 
		they could not enter. The walls of the city were too steep for any one 
		person to climb. They were too strong to be taken down by brute force. 
		And so, the people sat for days, unable to pass on through; but God had a 
		plan for His People. He told them to stand together and march together 
		around the city, and on the seventh day he told them that when they 
		heard the sound of the ram’s horn, they should speak with one voice. 
		And, at the chosen hour when the horn sounded and a chorus of voices 
		cried out together, the mighty walls of Jericho came tumbling down. 
		That’s what scripture tells us.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">And there are many 
		lessons to take from this passage, just as there are many lessons to 
		take from 
		this day, just as there are many memories that fill the space of this 
		church. As I was thinking about which ones we needed to remember at this 
		hour, my mind went back to the very beginning of the modern Civil Rights 
		era. Because before <font color="#0000FF">

		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing#Victims">
		<font color="#0000FF">loss of those four little girls</font></a>, before there 
		was King the icon and his <a href="../../speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">magnificent dream</font></a>, there was King the young 
		preacher and a people who found themselves suffering under the yolk of 
		oppression. And on the eve of the bus boycotts in Montgomery, at a time 
		when many were still doubtful about the possibilities of change, a time when 
		there were those in the black community who not only mistrusted each 
		other, but mistrusted themselves -- King inspired with words not of anger, 
		but of an urgency, a fierce urgency that still speaks to us today. 
		“Unity,” he said, “is the great need of the hour.” “Unity is the great 
		need of the hour.” Unity is how we shall overcome.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">What Dr. King 
		understood is that if just one person chose to walk instead of ri[de] the 
		bus, those walls of oppression would not be moved. But maybe if a few 
		more decided to walk, those foundations might start to shake. If just a 
		few women were willing to do what Rosa Parks had been willing to do, 
		maybe the cracks in those walls would start to show. If teenagers took 
		rides from North to South, maybe a few bricks would come loose. Maybe if 
		white folks marched because they’d come to understand that their 
		freedom was wrapped up in the freedom of others, that they too had a 
		stake in the impending battle, the walls would begin to sway, and if 
		enough Americans were awakened to injustice, if they joined together 
		North and South, rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, then perhaps that wall 
		would come tumbling down, and justice would flow like waters of 
		righteousness, like a mighty stream. “Unity is the great need of the 
		hour.” That’s what Dr. King said. It is the great need of this hour as 
		well, not because it sounds pleasant, not because it makes us feel good, 
		but because it's the only way we can overcome the essential deficit 
		that exits in this country.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">I’m not talking about 
		the budget deficit. I’m not talking about the trade deficit. Talking 
		about the moral deficit in this country. I’m talking about an empathy 
		deficit, the inability to recognize ourselves in one another, to 
		understand that we are our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper, 
		that in the 
		<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlktempleisraelhollywood.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">words of Dr. King</font></a>, “We are all tied together in a single 
		garment of destiny.” We have an 
		empathy deficit when we’re still sending our children down corridors of 
		shame, schools in the forgotten corners of America where the color of 
		your skin still affects the content of your education. We have a deficit 
		when CEOs are making more in ten minutes than ordinary workers are 
		making in an entire year, when families lose their homes so unscrupulous 
		lenders can make a profit, when mothers can’t afford a doctor when their 
		children are stricken with illness. We have a deficit in this country 
		when we have Scooter Libby justice for some and Jena justice for others, when our children see hanging nooses from 
		a school yard tree today, in the present, in the 21st 
		century. We have a deficit when homeless veterans sleep on the streets 
		of our cities, when innocents are slaughtered in the deserts of Darfur, 
		when young Americans serve tour after tour after tour after tour of 
		duty in a war that should have never been authorized and should have 
		never been waged. We have an empathy deficit in this country that has to 
		be closed. We have a deficit when it takes a breach in the levees to 
		reveal the breach in our compassion, when it takes a terrible storm to 
		reveal the hungry that God calls on us to feed, the sick that He calls 
		on us to care for, the least of these that He commands that we treat as 
		our own. So, we have a deficit to close. We have walls, barriers to 
		justice and equality that must come down, and to do this, we know that 
		“unity is the great need of the hour.”</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">However, all too 
		often, when we talk about unity in this country, we’ve come to believe 
		that it can be purchased on the cheap. We’ve come to believe that racial 
		reconciliation can come easily; that it’s just a matter of a few 
		ignorant people trapped in the prejudices of the past, and that if the 
		demagogues and those who would exploit our racial divisions will simply 
		go away then all our problems will be solved. All too often, we seek to 
		ignore the profound structural and institutional barriers that stand in 
		the way of insuring opportunity for all of our children, or decent jobs 
		for all of our people, or health care for those who are sick. We offer 
		unity, but we are not willing to pay the price that's required&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course, true unity cannot be so easily purchased. It 
		starts with a change in attitudes. It starts with changing our hearts, 
		and changing our minds, broadening our spirit. It’s not easy to stand in 
		somebody else’s shoes. It’s not easy to see past our own 
		differences. We’ve all encountered this in our own lives. What makes it 
		even more difficult is that we have a politics in this country that 
		seeks to drive us apart, that puts up walls between us. We are told that 
		those who differ from us on a few things, differ from us on all things, 
		that our problems are the fault of those who don’t think like us or look 
		like us or come from where we do. The Welfare Queen, she’s taking our 
		money. The Immigrant, he’s taking our jobs. The believer condemns the 
		nonbeliever as immoral, and the nonbeliever chides the believer for 
		being intolerant.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">And for most of this country’s history, we in the 
		African-American community have been at the receiving end of man’s 
		inhumanity to man. And all of us understand insidious -- All of us 
		understand intimately the insidious role that race still sometimes plays 
		on the job and in the schools, in our health care system, and in our 
		criminal justice system.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we 
		must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean. If we’re honest 
		with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not 
		always been true to King’s vision of a beloved community. If we’re 
		honest with ourselves, we have to admit that there have been times when 
		we've scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them. 
		The scourge of anti-Semitism has at times revealed itself in our 
		community. For too long, some of us have seen immigrants only as 
		competitors for jobs instead of companions in the fight for opportunity. Everyday our politics fuels and exploits this kind of division across 
		all races and regions, across gender and party. It is played out on 
		television; it is sensationalized by the media. Last week, it crept into 
		the campaign for President with charges and countercharges that serve to 
		obscure the issues instead of illuminating the critical choices we face 
		as a nation. None of our hands are clean.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">So let us say that on this day 
		of all days, each of us carries with us the task of changing our hearts 
		and minds. The divisions, the stereotypes, the scapegoating, the ease 
		with which we blame the plight of ourselves on others -- all of that 
		distracts us from the common challenges that we face, war and poverty, 
		inequality and injustice. We can no longer afford to build ourselves up 
		by tearing each other down. We can no longer afford to traffic in lies 
		or fear or hate. It's the poison that we must purge from our 
		politics, the wall that we must tear down before the hour grows too 
		late. Because if Dr. King could love his jailer, if he could call on the 
		faithful, who once sat where you do, to forgive those who had set dogs 
		and fire hoses upon them, then surely we can look past what divides us 
		in our time and bind up our wounds and erase the sympathy deficit that 
		exists in our hearts.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">But if changing our 
		hearts and our minds is the first critical step, we cannot stop there. It’s 
		not enough to bemoan the plight of the poor in this country and remain 
		unwilling to push our elected officials to provide the resources to fix 
		our schools. It's not enough to decry the disparities of health care 
		and yet allow the insurance companies and the drug companies to block 
		real reform in our health care system. It’s not enough -- It’s not 
		enough for us to abhor the costs of a misguided war, and yet we continue 
		to allow ourselves to be driven by a politics of fear that sees the 
		threat of an attack as a way to scare up votes instead of a call to come 
		together in a common effort.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">Scripture tells us 
		that we are judged not just by word but by deed. And if we are truly to 
		bring about the unity that is needed, that is so crucial in this time, 
		we have to find it within ourselves to act on what we know, to 
		understand that living up to this country’s ideals and its possibilities is 
		going to require great effort and great resources, sacrifice and 
		stamina. We can’t pass a law called 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act">
		<font color="#0000FF">No Child Left Behind</font></a> and then leave 
		the money behind. That is not a serious effort in bringing about the 
		unity that is needed. We can’t celebrate Dr. King’s dream, and yet still 
		have insufficient funds to cash that promissory note that was promised 
		at the beginning of this nation. That is what is at stake in this great 
		debate we are having today. Changes that are needed are not just a 
		matter of tinkering around the edges. They will not come if politicians 
		simply tell us what we want to hear. All of us will be called upon to 
		make some sacrifice. None of us will be exempt from responsibility. We've had to fight to fix our schools, but we also have to challenge 
		ourselves to be better parents, and turn off the television set, and put 
		away the video game, and our men have to be home with our children. That, 
		too, is part of the challenge that we must make.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">We will have to 
		confront the biases in our criminal justice system, but we also have to 
		acknowledge the deep-seeded violence that still resides in our own 
		communities, in too many of the hearts of our young people, and we have 
		to break the grip of that violence wherever we see it. That’s how we’re 
		going to bring about the change that we seek. That’s how Dr. King led 
		this country through the wilderness. He did it with words, words that he 
		spoke not just to the children of slaves but the children of slave 
		owners, words that inspired not just black but also white, not just 
		Christian but also Jew and Muslim and Buddhists and Atheists, not just 
		the southerner but also the northerner. He led with words, but he also 
		led with deeds. He also led by example. He led by marching and going to 
		jail and suffering threats and beatings and being away from his family. 
		He led by taking a stand against a war knowing full well that it would 
		diminish his popularity. He led by challenging our economic structures, 
		understanding that it would cause discomfort. Dr. King understood that 
		unity cannot be won on the cheap, that we would have to earn it through great 
		effort and determination. That’s the unity, the hard earned unity that 
		we need right now. That is the effort, the determination that can 
		transform blind optimism into hope.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">You know people have 
		remarked on the fact that I talk about hope a lot in my campaign. You 
		know they -- they tease me a little bit. Some have been scornful. They 
		say, “Ah, he’s talking about hope again. He’s so idealistic. He’s so 
		naïve. He’s a hope monger.” That’s okay. It’s true. I talk about 
		hope. I talk about it a lot because the odds of me standing here 
		today are so small, so remote that I couldn’t of gotten here without 
		some hope. You know my -- my daddy left me when I was two years old. I 
		needed some hope to get here. I was raised by a single mother. I needed 
		some hope to get here. I got in trouble when I was a teenager, did some 
		things folks now like to talk about. I needed some hope to get here. I 
		wasn’t born into money, or great wealth, or great privilege, or status. 
		I was given love, an education, and some hope. That’s what I got. That’s 
		my birthright.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		So I talk about hope. 
		I -- I put “Hope” on my campaign signs. It doesn’t even have my name on 
		them 
		sometimes -- just says “Hope.” Folks don’t know who they’re voting for, 
		but it makes them feel good. Say, you know, huh? I spoke about hope at 
		the <a href="../../speeches/convention2004/barackobama2004dnc.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">Democratic Convention</font></a>. I -- I wrote a book called 
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Audacity-Hope-Thoughts-Reclaiming-American/dp/0307237699">
		<font color="#0000FF">The Audacity of 
		Hope</font></a>. And so I -- so I’m puzzled when -- when some people, some of the 
		other candidates make a mockery of the idea. They say I’m pedaling false 
		hopes. &quot;Get a reality check,&quot; they tell me. And I have to -- I have to 
		try to understand what they're saying. The implication is is that if you 
		are hopeful, that you somehow must be engaging in wishful thinking. 
		Your -- Your head must be in the clouds; that you must be passive 
		and just sit back and wait for things to happen to you. That seems to be 
		the implication.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		And so I have to explain to people that’s not what 
		hope is. Hope is not blind optimism. Hope is not ignorance of the 
		barriers and hurdles and hazards that stand in your way. Hope’s just the 
		opposite. I know how hard it will be to provide health care to every 
		single American. The insurance companies, drug companies, they don’t 
		want to give up their profits. I know it won’t be easy to have a energy 
		policy that makes sense for America because the oil companies like writing the energy bills. I know that alleviating poverty, or making 
		sure all our children can learn, or eliminating the scourge of 
		racism in our society -- none of those things lend themselves to simple 
		solutions.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">I know because I fought on the streets as a 
		community organizer in poor neighborhoods on the Southside of Chicago 
		alongside those without jobs or without prospects for the future. I have 
		fought in the courts as a civil rights attorney for those who had been 
		denied opportunity on the job or denied access to the ballot box. I’ve 
		seen good legislation die because -- Well, I’ve seen that too -- I’ve seen good legislation die because good 
		intentions weren’t enough, because they weren’t fortified with a 
		political majority and political will. I’ve seen this country -- this 
		country’s judgment clouded by fear. I know how easily a country can be 
		misled when it is afraid. I know how hard it is. Everybody here 
		understands how difficult it is to bring about true change, change that 
		we can believe in. But I also know this -- that nothing in this country 
		worthwhile has ever happened except somebody somewhere decided to hope.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s how this country was founded because a group of patriots decided 
		they were going to take on the British Empire. Nobody was putting their 
		money on them. That’s how slaves and abolitionists resisted that evil 
		system. That’s how a new President was able to chart a course to insure 
		that this nation would no longer remain half slave and half free. That’s 
		how the greatest generation defeated Fascism and overcame a Great 
		Depression. That’s how women won the right to vote. That’s how workers 
		won the right to organize. That’s how young people and old people and 
		middle-aged folks were willing to walk instead of ride the bus, and folks 
		came down on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_ride">
		<font color="#0000FF">Freedom Rides</font></a>. They marched, and they sat in, and they were 
		beaten and fire houses were sent on them, and dogs were sent on them, 
		and some went to jail, and some died for freedom's cause. That’s what 
		hope is. Imagining and then fighting for and struggling for and 
		sometimes dying for what didn’t seem possible before. There’s nothing 
		naïve about that. There are no false hopes in that.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">I don’t believe in 
		false hopes. Imagine if John F. Kennedy had looked up at the moon and 
		said, &quot;Well, that’s too far.&quot; False hopes, we can’t go there. If Dr. King had 
		stood on the Lincoln Memorial and said, &quot;Y’all go home; we can’t overcome.&quot; There’s no such thing as false hopes, but what I know deep in my 
		heart is that we cannot bring about change unless we are unified, 
		unless we do it together. Change does not happen from the top down -- in 
		America or anywhere else. It happens from the bottom up. It happens 
		because ordinary people dream extraordinary things. It’s because all of 
		you decide that change must come. That I know.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">It wasn’t just one 
		voice -- It wasn't just one voice that shouted out before the walls of Jericho. All the voices came 
		together, a chorus of voices. That’s what gives me hope: not just those 
		who ascend to high office, but the changes that are happening in 
		ordinary places. The stories that give me my hope don’t happen in the 
		spotlight. When I think about Dr. King, I suspect he was sustained not 
		by having dinner with Presidents; not by getting the
		<a href="mlknobelpeaceprizeacceptance.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Nobel Peace Prize</font></a><font color="#0000FF">;</font> 
		but coming back to church and seeing the mothers of the church 
		and the deacons. Those who maintained their dignity were standing up 
		straight in the face of injustice. That’s where he drew his hope. He saw 
		God in their faces. Those stories don’t happen on a presidential stage; 
		they happen in the quiet quarters of our lives. They happen in the 
		moments we least expect. So, let me close by giving an example of one of 
		those stories.</font></p>

		<font face="Verdana" size="2">There is a young 
		woman, 23 years old, white woman, named Ashley Baia, who organizes for 
		our campaign in Florence, South Carolina. Ashley has been working 
		to organize mostly black folks. She’s in Florence, South Carolina. She’s 
		been doing it since the beginning of the campaign, and the other day she...set up a round table 
		discussion where everyone around was telling their story about 
		who they were and why they were there. And so, Ashley explained, she 
		started things off, by explaining why she was there. And she explained that 
		when she was nine years old her mother got cancer, and because she had 
		to miss a day of work she was let go; and she lost her health care; and 
		then she had to file for bankruptcy. They were on hard times, and 
		that’s when Ashley, nine-years-old at the time, decided she had to do 
		something to help her mom, and she knew that food was one of their most 
		expensive costs. They didn’t have a lot of money. Ashley lived in a poor 
		household.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">And so Ashley convinced her mother that she really liked and 
		really wanted to eat more than anything else mustard and relish 
		sandwiches. She had heard that condiments like mustard and relish were 
		cheap. And she -- she concocted in her own mind at the age of nine that she 
		would convince her mother that that’s the only thing she wanted to eat 
		everyday, because she figured that would be a way of saving money for the 
		family and helping them alleviate their hardships. So she did this for 
		a year until her mom got better. And in that round table she told 
		everyone that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could 
		help millions of other children in the country who want and need to help 
		their parents too. She had heard me speak about my mother having cancer 
		and having to worry about maybe not getting the health care she needed 
		because of a preexisting condition, and she had connected with that. She 
		thought, maybe Barack would fight for my mother. And if he would fight 
		for my mother, then maybe I will fight alongside him. That’s what had 
		brought her to Florence.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">So Ashley finishes 
		her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they’re supporting the campaign. 
		They all have different stories and different reasons: some bring up 
		specific issues; some talk about, upset about, affirmative action; some talk about, you 
		know, &quot;I want to see more jobs in the community&quot;; some are frustrated about 
		trade; some just like me.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">So they all got a bunch of different reasons, 
		and finally, at the end of this discussion, they come to this elderly 
		black man. He’s been sitting there quiet the whole time, hasn’t been 
		saying a word. And Ashley asks him why is he there. And he doesn’t bring 
		up a specific issue. He does not say healthcare or the economy. He 
		doesn’t talk about the Iraq War. He doesn’t say anything about 
		education. He doesn’t say that he’s there because he likes Barack Obama, 
		or he’s proud of the possibility of the first African American 
		President. He simply says to everyone in the room, “I am here because of 
		Ashley. I am here because of this young girl, and the fact that she's 
		willing to fight for what she believes in. And that reminds me that I 
		still have some fight left in me, and I’m going stand up for what I 
		believe in.”</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, by itself, that single moment of recognition between 
		that young white girl and that old black man, that’s not enough to 
		change a country. By itself, it’s not enough to give health care to the 
		sick or jobs to the jobless or education to our children, but it is 
		where we begin. It’s why I believe that the walls in that room began to 
		shake at that moment. And if they can shake in that room, then they can 
		shake here in Atlanta, and if they can shake in Atlanta, then they can 
		shake in the state of Georgia, and if they can shake in Georgia, they 
		can shake all across America. And if enough of our voices join together, 
		if we see each other in each other’s eyes, we can bring those walls 
		tumbling down. The walls of Jericho can finally come tumbling down.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">That is our hope, but 
		only if we pray together, if we work together, and if we march together. 
		Ebenezer, we cannot walk alone. Brothers and sisters, we cannot walk 
		alone. In the struggle for justice and for equality, we cannot walk 
		alone. In the struggle for opportunity and justice, we cannot walk 
		alone. In the struggle to heal this nation and repair the world, we 
		cannot walk alone. So I ask you to walk with me and march with me and 
		join your voices with mine, and together we will sing the song that 
		tears down the walls that divide us and lift up an America that is truly 
		indivisible with liberty and justice for all.</font></p>

		<font face="Verdana" size="2">May God bless the memory of the great pastor of this church.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">And may God bless the United States of 
		America.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you. Thank you.</font></p>
