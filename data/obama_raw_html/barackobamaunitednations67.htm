<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#CE0A04" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, Mr. Secretary 
		General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentleman:&nbsp; I would like to begin 
		today by telling you about an American named 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Christopher_Stevens">
		<font color="#0000FF">Chris Stevens</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chris was born in a town 
		called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician.&nbsp; As 
		a young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps, and taught English in 
		Morocco.&nbsp; And he came to love and respect the people of North Africa and 
		the Middle East. He would carry that commitment throughout his life.&nbsp; As 
		a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria, from Saudi Arabia to Libya.&nbsp; 
		He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked -- 
		tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking 
		Arabic, listening with a broad smile.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chris went to Benghazi in 
		the early days of the Libyan revolution, arriving on a cargo ship.&nbsp; As 
		America’s representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with 
		violent conflict, cared for the wounded, and crafted a vision for the 
		future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected. And after 
		the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy, as Libyans 
		held elections, and built new institutions, and began to move forward 
		after decades of dictatorship.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chris Stevens loved his 
		work.&nbsp; He took pride in the country he served, and he saw dignity in the 
		people that he met.&nbsp; And two weeks ago, he traveled to Benghazi to 
		review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a 
		hospital.&nbsp; That’s when America’s compound came under attack.&nbsp; Along with 
		three of his colleagues, Chris was killed in the city that he helped to 
		save. He was 52 years old.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I tell you this story 
		because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America.&nbsp; Like his fellow 
		Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures, 
		and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United 
		Nations represents.&nbsp; He acted with humility, but he also stood up for a 
		set of principles -- a belief that individuals should be free to 
		determine their own destiny, and live with liberty, dignity, justice, 
		and opportunity.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The attacks on the civilians 
		in Benghazi were attacks on America.&nbsp; We are grateful for the assistance 
		we received from the Libyan government and from the Libyan people.&nbsp; 
		There should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the 
		killers and bringing them to justice.&nbsp; And I also appreciate that in 
		recent days, the leaders of other countries in the region -- including 
		Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen -- have taken steps to secure our diplomatic 
		facilities, and called for calm.&nbsp; And so have religious authorities 
		around the globe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But understand, the attacks 
		of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America.&nbsp; They are 
		also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was 
		founded -- the notion that people can resolve their differences 
		peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; that in an 
		interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater 
		opportunity and security for our citizens.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If we are serious about 
		upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in 
		front of an embassy, or to put out statements of regret and wait for the 
		outrage to pass.&nbsp; If we are serious about these ideals, we must speak 
		honestly about the deeper causes of the crisis -- because we face a 
		choice between the forces that would drive us apart and the hopes that 
		we hold in common.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, we must reaffirm that 
		our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens -- and not by 
		his killers.&nbsp; Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance 
		has no place among our United Nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been less than two 
		years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the 
		oppressive corruption in his country, and sparked what became known as 
		the Arab Spring.&nbsp; And since then, the world has been captivated by the 
		transformation that’s taken place, and the United States has supported 
		the forces of change.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We were inspired by the 
		Tunisian protests that toppled a dictator, because we recognized our own 
		beliefs in the aspiration of men and women who took to the streets.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We insisted on change in 
		Egypt, because our support for democracy ultimately put us on the side 
		of the people.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We supported a transition of 
		leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were no longer 
		being served by a corrupt status quo.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We intervened in Libya 
		alongside a broad coalition, and with the mandate of the United Nations 
		Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of 
		innocents, and because we believed that the aspirations of the people 
		were more powerful than a tyrant.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as we meet here, we 
		again declare that the regime of Bashar al-Assad must come to an end so 
		that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop and a new dawn can 
		begin.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have taken these 
		positions because we believe that freedom and self-determination are not 
		unique to one culture.&nbsp; These are not simply American values or Western 
		values -- they are universal values.&nbsp; And even as there will be huge 
		challenges to come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that 
		ultimately government of the people, by the people, and for the people 
		is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity, and individual 
		opportunity that serve as a basis for peace in our world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let us remember that this 
		is a season of progress.&nbsp; For the first time in decades, Tunisians, 
		Egyptians and Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were 
		credible, competitive, and fair.&nbsp; This democratic spirit has not been 
		restricted to the Arab world.&nbsp; Over the past year, we’ve seen peaceful 
		transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal, and a new President in 
		Somalia.&nbsp; In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened 
		a closed society, a courageous dissident has been elected to parliament, 
		and people look forward to further reform.&nbsp; Around the globe, people are 
		making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity, and the 
		right to determine their future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet the turmoil of 
		recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the 
		casting of a ballot.&nbsp; Nelson Mandela once said:&nbsp; &quot;To be free is not 
		merely to cast off one’s chains, but to live in a way that respects and 
		enhances the freedom of others.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">True democracy demands that 
		citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe, and that 
		businesses can be opened without paying a bribe.&nbsp; It depends on the 
		freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear, and 
		on the rule of law and due process that guarantees the rights of all 
		people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In other words, true 
		democracy -- real freedom -- is hard work.&nbsp; Those in power have to 
		resist the temptation to crack down on dissidents.&nbsp; In hard economic 
		times, countries must be tempted -- may be tempted to rally the people 
		around perceived enemies, at home and abroad, rather than focusing on 
		the painstaking work of reform.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, there will always 
		be those that reject human progress -- dictators who cling to power, 
		corrupt interests that depend on the status quo, and extremists who fan 
		the flames of hate and division.&nbsp; From Northern Ireland to South Asia, 
		from Africa to the Americas, from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we’ve 
		witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political 
		order.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At time, the conflicts arise 
		along the fault lines of race or tribe.&nbsp; And often they arise from the 
		difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and 
		interdependence of the modern world.&nbsp; In every country, there are those 
		who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, 
		those who love freedom for themselves must ask themselves how much 
		they’re willing to tolerate freedom for others.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is what we saw play out 
		in the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage 
		throughout the Muslim world.&nbsp; Now, I have made it clear that the United 
		States government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its 
		message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well -- for as 
		the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has 
		welcomed people of every race and every faith.&nbsp; We are home to Muslims 
		who worship across our country.&nbsp; We not only respect the freedom of 
		religion, we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed 
		because of how they look or what they believe.&nbsp; We understand why people 
		take offense to this video because millions of our citizens are among 
		them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know there are some who 
		ask why we don’t just ban such a video.&nbsp; And the answer is enshrined in 
		our laws:&nbsp; Our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here in the United States, 
		countless publications provoke offense.&nbsp; Like me, the majority of 
		Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our 
		most sacred beliefs.&nbsp; As President of our country and Commander-in-Chief 
		of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things 
		every day -- and I will always defend their right to do 
		so.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana">
<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobama2012unitednations.jpg" width="353" height="234">
</font>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Americans have fought and 
		died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express 
		their views, even views that we profoundly disagree with.&nbsp; We do not do 
		so because we support hateful speech, but because our founders 
		understood that without such protections, the capacity of each 
		individual to express their own views and practice their own faith may 
		be threatened.&nbsp; We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to 
		restrict speech can quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppress 
		minorities.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We do so because given the 
		power of faith in our lives, and the passion that religious differences 
		can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not 
		repression; it is more speech -- the voices of tolerance that rally 
		against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding 
		and mutual respect.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know that not all 
		countries in this body share this particular understanding of the 
		protection of free speech.&nbsp; We recognize that.&nbsp; But in 2012, at a time 
		when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the 
		world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the 
		flow of information is obsolete.&nbsp; The question, then, is how do we 
		respond?&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And on this we must agree:&nbsp; 
		There is no speech that justifies mindless violence.&nbsp; There 
		are no words that excuse the killing of innocents.&nbsp; There's no video 
		that justifies an attack on an embassy.&nbsp; There's no slander that 
		provides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in Lebanon, or 
		destroy a school in Tunis, or cause death and destruction in Pakistan.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this modern world with 
		modern technologies, for us to respond in that way to hateful speech 
		empowers any individual who engages in such speech to create chaos 
		around the world.&nbsp; We empower the worst of us if that’s how we respond.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">More broadly, the events of 
		the last two weeks also speak to the need for all of us to honestly 
		address the tensions between the West and the Arab world that is moving 
		towards democracy.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let me be clear:&nbsp; Just 
		as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the United States has not 
		and will not seek to dictate the outcome of democratic transitions 
		abroad.&nbsp; We do not expect other nations to agree with us on every issue, 
		nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks or the hateful 
		speech by some individuals represent the views of the overwhelming 
		majority of Muslims, any more than the views of the people who produced 
		this video represents those of Americans.&nbsp; However, I do believe that it 
		is the obligation of all leaders in all countries to speak out 
		forcefully against violence and extremism.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is time to marginalize 
		those who -- even when not directly resorting to violence -- use hatred 
		of America, or the West, or Israel, as the central organizing principle 
		of politics. For that only gives cover, and sometimes makes an excuse, 
		for those who do resort to violence.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That brand of politics -- 
		one that pits East against West, and South against North, Muslims 
		against Christians and Hindu and Jews -- can’t deliver on the promise of 
		freedom.&nbsp; To the youth, it offers only false hope.&nbsp; Burning an American 
		flag does nothing to provide a child an education.&nbsp; Smashing apart a 
		restaurant does not fill an empty stomach.&nbsp; Attacking an embassy won’t 
		create a single job.&nbsp; That brand of politics only makes it harder to 
		achieve what we must do together:&nbsp; educating our children, and creating 
		the opportunities that they deserve; protecting human rights, and 
		extending democracy’s promise.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Understand America will 
		never retreat from the world.&nbsp; We will bring justice to those who harm 
		our citizens and our friends, and we will stand with our allies.&nbsp; We are 
		willing to partner with countries around the world to deepen ties of 
		trade and investment, and science and technology, energy and development 
		-- all efforts that can spark economic growth for all our people and 
		stabilize democratic change.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But such efforts depend on a 
		spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect.&nbsp; No government or company, 
		no school or NGO will be confident working in a country where its people 
		are endangered.&nbsp; For partnerships to be effective our citizens must be 
		secure and our efforts must be welcomed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A politics based only on 
		anger -- one based on dividing the world between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; -- not 
		only sets back international cooperation, it ultimately undermines those 
		who tolerate it.&nbsp; All of us have an interest in standing up to these 
		forces.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us remember that Muslims 
		have suffered the most at the hands of extremism.&nbsp; On the same day our 
		civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police officer was murdered 
		in Istanbul only days before his wedding; more than 10 Yemenis were 
		killed in a car bomb in Sana’a; several Afghan children were mourned by 
		their parents just days after they were killed by a suicide bomber in 
		Kabul.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The impulse towards 
		intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the West, but over 
		time it cannot be contained.&nbsp; The same impulses toward extremism are 
		used to justify war between Sunni and Shia, between tribes and clans.&nbsp; 
		It leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos.&nbsp; In less than two 
		years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to 
		Muslim-majority countries than a decade of violence.&nbsp; And extremists 
		understand this.&nbsp; Because they have nothing to offer to improve the 
		lives of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant.&nbsp; They 
		don’t build; they only destroy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is time to leave the call 
		of violence and the politics of division behind.&nbsp; On so many issues, we 
		face a choice between the promise of the future, or the prisons of the 
		past.&nbsp; And we cannot afford to get it wrong.&nbsp; We must seize this 
		moment.&nbsp; And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to 
		embrace a better future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The future must not belong 
		to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt -- it must be claimed by 
		those in Tahrir Square who chanted, &quot;Muslims, Christians, we are one.&quot;&nbsp; 
		The future must not belong to those who bully women -- it must be shaped 
		by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our 
		daughters can live their dreams just like our sons.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The future must not belong 
		to those corrupt few who steal a country’s resources -- it must be won 
		by the students and entrepreneurs, the workers and business owners who 
		seek a broader prosperity for all people.&nbsp; Those are the women and men 
		that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support.&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.&nbsp; 
		But to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the 
		hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated, or 
		churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is denied.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us condemn incitement 
		against Sufi Muslims and Shiite pilgrims.&nbsp; It’s time to heed the words 
		of Gandhi:&nbsp; &quot;Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to 
		the growth of a true democratic spirit.&quot;&nbsp; Together, we must 
		work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, and 
		not defined by them.&nbsp; That is what America embodies, that’s the vision 
		we will support.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Among Israelis and 
		Palestinians, the future must not belong to those who turn their backs 
		on a prospect of peace.&nbsp; Let us leave behind those who thrive on 
		conflict, those who reject the right of Israel to exist.&nbsp; The road is 
		hard, but the destination is clear -- a secure, Jewish state of Israel 
		and an independent, prosperous Palestine.&nbsp; Understanding 
		that such a peace must come through a just agreement between the 
		parties, America will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that 
		journey.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Syria, the future must 
		not belong to a dictator who massacres his people.&nbsp; If there is a cause 
		that cries out for protest in the world today, peaceful protest, it is a 
		regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment 
		buildings.&nbsp; And we must remain engaged to assure that what began with 
		citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian 
		violence.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Together, we must stand with 
		those Syrians who believe in a different vision -- a Syria that is 
		united and inclusive, where children don’t need to fear their own 
		government, and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed -- 
		Sunnis and Alawites, Kurds and Christians.&nbsp; That’s what America stands 
		for.&nbsp; That is the outcome that we will work for -- with sanctions and 
		consequences for those who persecute, and assistance and support for 
		those who work for this common good.&nbsp; Because we believe that the 
		Syrians who embrace this vision will have the strength and the 
		legitimacy to lead.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Iran, we see where the 
		path of a violent and unaccountable ideology leads.&nbsp; The Iranian people 
		have a remarkable and ancient history, and many Iranians wish to enjoy 
		peace and prosperity alongside their neighbors.&nbsp; But just as it 
		restricts the rights of its own people, the Iranian government continues 
		to prop up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist groups abroad.&nbsp; 
		Time and again, it has failed to take the opportunity to demonstrate 
		that its nuclear program is peaceful, and to meet its obligations to the 
		United Nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let me be clear.&nbsp; America 
		wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there 
		is still time and space to do so.&nbsp; But that time is not unlimited.&nbsp; We 
		respect the right of nations to access peaceful nuclear power, but one 
		of the purposes of the United Nations is to see that we harness that 
		power for peace.&nbsp; And make no mistake, a nuclear-armed Iran is not a 
		challenge that can be contained.&nbsp; It would threaten the elimination of 
		Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global 
		economy.&nbsp; It risks triggering a nuclear-arms race in the region, and the 
		unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty.&nbsp; That’s why a coalition of 
		countries is holding the Iranian government accountable.&nbsp; And that’s why 
		the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a 
		nuclear weapon.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know from painful 
		experience that the path to security and prosperity does not lie outside 
		the boundaries of international law and respect for human rights.&nbsp; 
		That’s why this institution was established from the rubble of 
		conflict.&nbsp; That is why liberty triumphed over tyranny in the Cold War.&nbsp; 
		And that is the lesson of the last two decades as well.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">History shows that peace and 
		progress come to those who make the right choices.&nbsp; Nations in every 
		part of the world have traveled this difficult path.&nbsp; Europe, the 
		bloodiest battlefield of the 20th century, is united, free and at 
		peace.&nbsp; From Brazil to South Africa, from Turkey to South Korea, from 
		India to Indonesia, people of different races, religions, and traditions 
		have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of 
		their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it is because of the 
		progress that I’ve witnessed in my own lifetime, the progress that I’ve 
		witnessed after nearly four years as President, that I remain ever 
		hopeful about the world that we live in.&nbsp; The war in Iraq is over.&nbsp; 
		American troops have come home.&nbsp; We’ve begun a transition in 
		Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 
		2014.&nbsp; Al Qaeda has been weakened, and Osama bin Laden is no more.&nbsp; 
		Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America 
		and Russia are reducing our arsenals.&nbsp; We have seen hard choices made -- 
		from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan -- to put more power in the hands of 
		citizens.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At a time of economic 
		challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity.&nbsp; Through 
		the G20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on 
		the path of recovery.&nbsp; America has pursued a development agenda that 
		fuels growth and breaks dependency, and worked with African leaders to 
		help them feed their nations.&nbsp; New partnerships have been forged to 
		combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent, 
		and new commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership 
		to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and 
		pursue opportunity.&nbsp; And later today, I will discuss our efforts to 
		combat the scourge of human trafficking.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All these things give me 
		hope.&nbsp; But what gives me the most hope is not the actions of us, not the 
		actions of leaders -- it is the people that I’ve seen.&nbsp; The American 
		troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for 
		strangers half a world away; the students in Jakarta or Seoul who are 
		eager to use their knowledge to benefit mankind; the faces in a square 
		in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to 
		their aspirations; the young people in the favelas of Rio and the 
		schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise.&nbsp; These men, women, and 
		children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry 
		mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the world 
		who share similar hopes and dreams.&nbsp; They tell us that there is a common 
		heartbeat to humanity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So much attention in our 
		world turns to what divides us.&nbsp; That’s what we see on the news.&nbsp; That's 
		what consumes our political debates.&nbsp; But when you strip it all away, 
		people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny; the 
		dignity that comes with work; the comfort that comes with faith; and the 
		justice that exists when governments serve their people&nbsp; -- and not the 
		other way around.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The United States of America 
		will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people and for 
		people all across the world.&nbsp; That was our founding purpose.&nbsp; That is 
		what our history shows.&nbsp; That is what Chris Stevens worked for 
		throughout his life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I promise you this:&nbsp; 
		Long after the killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens’s legacy 
		will live on in the lives that he touched -- in the tens of thousands 
		who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the 
		Libyans who changed their Facebook photo to one of Chris; in the signs 
		that read, simply, &quot;Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They should give us hope.&nbsp; 
		They should remind us that so long as we work for it, justice will be 
		done, that history is on our side, and that a rising tide of liberty 
		will never be reversed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.</font></p>
