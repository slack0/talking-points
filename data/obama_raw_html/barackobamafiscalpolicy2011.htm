transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is wonderful to be back 
		at GW.&nbsp; I want you to know that one of the reasons that I worked so hard 
		with Democrats and Republicans to keep the government open was so that I 
		could show up here today.&nbsp; I wanted to make sure that all of you had one 
		more excuse to skip class.&nbsp;You’re welcome.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to give a special 
		thanks to Steven Knapp, the president of GW.&nbsp; I just saw him -- where is 
		he?&nbsp; There he is right there.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've got a lot of 
		distinguished guests here -- a couple of people I want to acknowledge.&nbsp; 
		First of all, my outstanding Vice President, Joe Biden, is here.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Our Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, is in the house.&nbsp; Jack Lew, 
		the Director of the Office of Mangement and Budget.&nbsp; Gene Sperling, 
		Chair of the National Economic Council, is here.&nbsp; Members of our 
		bipartisan Fiscal Commission are here, including the two outstanding 
		chairs -- Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson -- are here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we have a number of 
		members of Congress here today.&nbsp; I'm grateful for all of you taking the 
		time to attend.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What we’ve been debating 
		here in Washington over the last few weeks will affect the lives of the 
		students here and families all across America in potentially profound 
		ways.&nbsp; This debate over budgets and deficits is about more than just 
		numbers on a page; it’s about more than just cutting and spending.&nbsp; It’s 
		about the kind of future that we want.&nbsp; It’s about the kind of country 
		that we believe in.&nbsp; And that’s what I want to spend some time talking 
		about today.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">From our first days as a 
		nation, we have put our faith in free markets and free enterprise as the 
		engine of America’s wealth and prosperity.&nbsp; More than citizens of any 
		other country, we are rugged individualists, a self-reliant people with 
		a healthy skepticism of too much government.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there’s always been 
		another thread running through our history -– a belief that we’re all 
		connected, and that there are some things we can only do together, as a 
		nation.&nbsp; We believe, in the words of our first Republican President, 
		Abraham Lincoln, that through government, we should do together what we 
		cannot do as well for ourselves.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so we’ve built a strong 
		military to keep us secure, and public schools and universities to 
		educate our citizens.&nbsp; We’ve laid down railroads and highways to 
		facilitate travel and commerce.&nbsp; We’ve supported the work of scientists 
		and researchers whose discoveries have saved lives, unleashed repeated 
		technological revolutions, and led to countless new jobs and entire new 
		industries.&nbsp; Each of us has benefitted from these investments, and we’re 
		a more prosperous country as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		Part of this American belief that we’re all connected also expresses 
		itself in a conviction that each one of us deserves some basic measure 
		of security and dignity.&nbsp; We recognize that no matter how responsibly we 
		live our lives, hard times or bad luck, a crippling illness or a layoff 
		may strike any one of us.&nbsp; “There but for the grace of God go I,” we say 
		to ourselves.&nbsp; And so we contribute to programs like Medicare and Social 
		Security, which guarantee us health care and a measure of basic income 
		after a lifetime of hard work; unemployment insurance, which protects us 
		against unexpected job loss; and Medicaid, which provides care for 
		millions of seniors in nursing homes, poor children, those with 
		disabilities.&nbsp; We’re a better country because of these commitments.&nbsp; 
		I’ll go further.&nbsp; We would not be a great country without those 
		commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, for much of the last 
		century, our nation found a way to afford these investments and 
		priorities with the taxes paid by its citizens.&nbsp; As a country that 
		values fairness, wealthier individuals have traditionally borne a 
		greater share of this burden than the middle class or those less 
		fortunate.&nbsp; Everybody pays, but the wealthier have borne a little more.&nbsp; 
		This is not because we begrudge those who’ve done well -– we rightly 
		celebrate their success.&nbsp; Instead, it’s a basic reflection of our belief 
		that those who’ve benefited most from our way of life can afford to give 
		back a little bit more.&nbsp; Moreover, this belief hasn’t hindered the 
		success of those at the top of the income scale.&nbsp; They continue to do 
		better and better with each passing year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, at certain times -– 
		particularly during war or recession -– our nation has had to borrow 
		money to pay for some of our priorities.&nbsp; And as most families 
		understand, a little credit card debt isn’t going to hurt if it’s 
		temporary.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But as far back as the 
		1980s, America started amassing debt at more alarming levels, and our 
		leaders began to realize that a larger challenge was on the horizon.&nbsp; 
		They knew that eventually, the Baby Boom generation would retire, which 
		meant a much bigger portion of our citizens would be relying on programs 
		like Medicare, Social Security, and possibly Medicaid.&nbsp; Like parents 
		with young children who know they have to start saving for the college 
		years, America had to start borrowing less and saving more to prepare 
		for the retirement of an entire generation.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To meet this challenge, our 
		leaders came together three times during the 1990s to reduce our 
		nation’s deficit -- three times.&nbsp; They forged historic agreements that 
		required tough decisions made by the first President Bush, then made by 
		President Clinton, by Democratic Congresses and by a Republican 
		Congress.&nbsp; All three agreements asked for shared responsibility and 
		shared sacrifice.&nbsp; But they largely protected the middle class; they 
		largely protected our commitment to seniors; they protected our key 
		investments in our future.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a result of these 
		bipartisan efforts, America’s finances were in great shape by the year 
		2000.&nbsp; We went from deficit to surplus.&nbsp; America was actually on track 
		to becoming completely debt free, and we were prepared for the 
		retirement of the Baby Boomers.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But after Democrats and 
		Republicans committed to fiscal discipline during the 1990s, we lost our 
		way in the decade that followed.&nbsp; We increased spending dramatically for 
		two wars and an expensive prescription drug program -– but we didn’t pay 
		for any of this new spending.&nbsp; Instead, we made the problem worse with 
		trillions of dollars in unpaid-for tax cuts -– tax cuts that went to 
		every millionaire and billionaire in the country; tax cuts that will 
		force us to borrow an average of $500 billion every year over the next 
		decade.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To give you an idea of how 
		much damage this caused to our nation’s checkbook, consider this:&nbsp; In 
		the last decade, if we had simply found a way to pay for the tax cuts 
		and the prescription drug benefit, our deficit would currently be at low 
		historical levels in the coming years.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But that’s not what 
		happened.&nbsp; And so, by the time I took office, we once again found 
		ourselves deeply in debt and unprepared for a Baby Boom retirement that 
		is now starting to take place.&nbsp; When I took office, our projected 
		deficit, annually, was more than $1 trillion.&nbsp; On top of that, we faced 
		a terrible financial crisis and a recession that, like most recessions, 
		led us to temporarily borrow even more.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this case, we took a 
		series of emergency steps that saved millions of jobs, kept credit 
		flowing, and provided working families extra money in their pocket.&nbsp; It 
		was absolutely the right thing to do, but these steps were expensive, 
		and added to our deficits in the short term.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So that’s how our fiscal 
		challenge was created.&nbsp; That’s how we got here.&nbsp; And now that our 
		economic recovery is gaining strength, Democrats and Republicans must 
		come together and restore the fiscal responsibility that served us so 
		well in the 1990s.&nbsp; We have to live within our means.&nbsp; We have to reduce 
		our deficit, and we have to get back on a path that will allow us to pay 
		down our debt.&nbsp; And we have to do it in a way that protects the 
		recovery, protects the investments we need to grow, create jobs, and 
		helps us win the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, before I get into how 
		we can achieve this goal, some of you, particularly the younger people 
		here -- you don't qualify, Joe.&nbsp; Some of you might be 
		wondering, “Why is this so important?&nbsp; Why does this matter to me?”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, here’s why.&nbsp; Even 
		after our economy recovers, our government will still be on track to 
		spend more money than it takes in throughout this decade and beyond.&nbsp; 
		That means we’ll have to keep borrowing more from countries like China.&nbsp; 
		That means more of your tax dollars each year will go towards paying off 
		the interest on all the loans that we keep taking out.&nbsp; By the end of 
		this decade, the interest that we owe on our debt could rise to nearly 
		$1 trillion.&nbsp; Think about that.&nbsp; That's the interest -- just the 
		interest payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then, as the Baby Boomers 
		start to retire in greater numbers and health care costs continue to 
		rise, the situation will get even worse.&nbsp; By 2025, the amount of taxes 
		we currently pay will only be enough to finance our health care programs 
		-- Medicare and Medicaid -- Social Security, and the interest we owe on 
		our debt.&nbsp; That’s it.&nbsp; Every other national priority -– education, 
		transportation, even our national security -– will have to be paid for 
		with borrowed money.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, ultimately, all this 
		rising debt will cost us jobs and damage our economy.&nbsp; It will prevent 
		us from making the investments we need to win the future.&nbsp; We won’t be 
		able to afford good schools, new research, or the repair of roads -– all 
		the things that create new jobs and businesses here in America.&nbsp; 
		Businesses will be less likely to invest and open shop in a country that 
		seems unwilling or unable to balance its books.&nbsp; And if our creditors 
		start worrying that we may be unable to pay back our debts, that could 
		drive up interest rates for everybody who borrows money -– making it 
		harder for businesses to expand and hire, or families to take out a 
		mortgage.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here’s the good news:&nbsp; That 
		doesn’t have to be our future.&nbsp; That doesn’t have to be the country that 
		we leave our children.&nbsp; We can solve this problem.&nbsp; We came together as 
		Democrats and Republicans to meet this challenge before; we can do it 
		again.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But that starts by being 
		honest about what’s causing our deficit.&nbsp; You see, most Americans tend 
		to dislike government spending in the abstract, but like the stuff that 
		it buys.&nbsp; Most of us, regardless of party affiliation, believe that we 
		should have a strong military and a strong defense.&nbsp; Most Americans 
		believe we should invest in education and medical research.&nbsp; Most 
		Americans think we should protect commitments like Social Security and 
		Medicare.&nbsp; And without even looking at a poll, my finely honed political 
		instincts tell me that almost nobody believes they should be paying 
		higher taxes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So because all this spending 
		is popular with both Republicans and Democrats alike, and because nobody 
		wants to pay higher taxes, politicians are often eager to feed the 
		impression that solving the problem is just a matter of eliminating 
		waste and abuse.&nbsp; You’ll hear that phrase a lot.&nbsp; “We just need to 
		eliminate waste and abuse.”&nbsp; The implication is that tackling the 
		deficit issue won’t require tough choices.&nbsp; Or politicians suggest that 
		we can somehow close our entire deficit by eliminating things like 
		foreign aid, even though foreign aid makes up about 1 percent of our 
		entire federal budget.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So here’s the truth.&nbsp; Around 
		two-thirds of our budget -- two-thirds -- is spent on Medicare, 
		Medicaid, Social Security, and national security.&nbsp; Two-thirds.&nbsp; Programs 
		like unemployment<br>
		insurance, student loans, veterans’ benefits, and tax credits for 
		working families take up another 20 percent.&nbsp; What’s left, after 
		interest on the debt, is just 12 percent for everything else.&nbsp; That’s 12 
		percent for all of our national priorities -- education, clean energy, 
		medical research, transportation, our national parks, food safety, 
		keeping our air and water clean -- you name it -- all of that accounts 
		for 12 percent of our budget.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, up till now, the debate 
		here in Washington, the cuts proposed by a lot of folks in Washington, 
		have focused exclusively on that 12 percent.&nbsp; But cuts to that 12 
		percent alone won’t solve the problem.&nbsp; So any serious plan to tackle 
		our deficit will require us to put everything on the table, and take on 
		excess spending wherever it exists in the budget.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A serious plan doesn’t 
		require us to balance our budget overnight –- in fact, economists think 
		that with the economy just starting to grow again, we need a phased-in 
		approach –- but it does require tough decisions and support from our 
		leaders in both parties now.&nbsp; Above all, it will require us to choose a 
		vision of the America we want to see five years, 10 years, 20 years down 
		the road.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, to their credit, one 
		vision has been presented and championed by Republicans in the House of 
		Representatives and embraced by several of their party’s presidential 
		candidates.&nbsp; It’s a plan that aims to reduce our deficit by $4 trillion 
		over the next 10 years, and one that addresses the challenge of Medicare 
		and Medicaid in the years after that.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are both worthy 
		goals.&nbsp; They’re worthy goals for us to achieve.&nbsp; But the way this plan 
		achieves those goals would lead to a fundamentally different America 
		than the one we’ve known certainly in my lifetime.&nbsp; In fact, I think it 
		would be fundamentally different than what we’ve known throughout our 
		history.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A 70 percent cut in clean 
		energy.&nbsp; A 25 percent cut in education.&nbsp; A 30 percent cut in 
		transportation.&nbsp; Cuts in college Pell Grants that will grow to more than 
		$1,000 per year.&nbsp; That’s the proposal.&nbsp; These aren’t the kind of cuts 
		you make when you’re trying to get rid of some waste or find extra 
		savings in the budget.&nbsp; These aren’t the kinds of cuts that the Fiscal 
		Commission proposed.&nbsp; These are the kinds of cuts that tell us we can’t 
		afford the America that I believe in and I think you believe in.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believe it paints a vision 
		of our future that is deeply pessimistic.&nbsp; It’s a vision that says if 
		our roads crumble and our bridges collapse, we can’t afford to fix 
		them.&nbsp; If there are bright young Americans who have the drive and the 
		will but not the money to go to college, we can’t afford to send them.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Go to China and you’ll see 
		businesses opening research labs and solar facilities.&nbsp; South Korean 
		children are outpacing our kids in math and science.&nbsp; They’re scrambling 
		to figure out how they put more money into education.&nbsp; Brazil is 
		investing billions in new infrastructure and can run half their cars not 
		on high-priced gasoline, but on biofuels.&nbsp; And yet, we are presented 
		with a vision that says the American people, the United States of 
		America -– the greatest nation on Earth -– can’t afford any of this.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s a vision that says 
		America can’t afford to keep the promise we’ve made to care for our 
		seniors.&nbsp; It says that 10 years from now, if you’re a 65-year-old who’s 
		eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than 
		you would today.&nbsp; It says instead of guaranteed health care, you will 
		get a voucher.&nbsp; And if that voucher isn’t worth enough to buy the 
		insurance that’s available in the open marketplace, well, tough luck -– 
		you’re on your own.&nbsp; Put simply, it ends Medicare as we know it.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s a vision that says up 
		to 50 million Americans have to lose their health insurance in order for 
		us to reduce the deficit.&nbsp; Who are these 50 million Americans?&nbsp; Many are 
		somebody’s grandparents -- may be one of yours -- who wouldn’t be able 
		to afford nursing home care without Medicaid.&nbsp; Many are poor children.&nbsp; 
		Some are middle-class families who have children with autism or Down’s 
		syndrome.&nbsp; Some of these kids with disabilities are -- the disabilities 
		are so severe that they require 24-hour care.&nbsp; These are the Americans 
		we’d be telling to fend for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And worst of all, this is a 
		vision that says even though Americans can’t afford to invest in 
		education at current levels, or clean energy, even though we can’t 
		afford to maintain our commitment on Medicare and Medicaid, we can 
		somehow afford more than $1 trillion in new tax breaks for the wealthy.&nbsp; 
		Think about that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the last decade, the 
		average income of the bottom 90 percent of all working Americans 
		actually declined.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the top 1 percent saw their income rise 
		by an average of more than a quarter of a million dollars each.&nbsp; That’s 
		who needs to pay less taxes?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They want to give people 
		like me a $200,000 tax cut that’s paid for by asking 33 seniors each to 
		pay $6,000 more in health costs.&nbsp; That’s not right.&nbsp; And it’s not going 
		to happen as long as I’m President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This vision is less about 
		reducing the deficit than it is about changing the basic social compact 
		in America.&nbsp; Ronald Reagan’s own budget director said, there’s nothing 
		“serious” or “courageous” about this plan.&nbsp; There’s nothing serious 
		about a plan that claims to reduce the deficit by spending a trillion 
		dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.&nbsp; And I don't 
		think there’s anything courageous about asking for sacrifice from those 
		who can least afford it and don’t have any clout on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; 
		That's not a vision of the America I know.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The America I know is 
		generous and compassionate.&nbsp; It’s a land of opportunity and optimism.&nbsp; 
		Yes, we take responsibility for ourselves, but we also take 
		responsibility for each other; for the country we want and the future 
		that we share.&nbsp; We’re a nation that built a railroad across a continent 
		and brought light to communities shrouded in darkness.&nbsp; We sent a 
		generation to college on the GI Bill and we saved millions of seniors 
		from poverty with Social Security and Medicare.&nbsp; We have led the world 
		in scientific research and technological breakthroughs that have 
		transformed millions of lives.&nbsp; That’s who we are.&nbsp; This is the America 
		that I know.&nbsp; We don’t have to choose between a future of spiraling debt 
		and one where we forfeit our investment in our people and our country.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To meet our fiscal 
		challenge, we will need to make reforms. We will all need to make 
		sacrifices.&nbsp; But we do not have to sacrifice the America we believe in.&nbsp; 
		And as long as I’m President, we won’t.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today, I’m proposing a 
		more balanced approach to achieve $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 
		12 years.&nbsp; It’s an approach that borrows from the recommendations of the 
		bipartisan Fiscal Commission that I appointed last year, and it builds 
		on the roughly $1 trillion in deficit reduction I already proposed in my 
		2012 budget.&nbsp; It’s an approach that puts every kind of spending on the 
		table -- but one that protects the middle class, our promise to seniors, 
		and our investments in the future.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first step in our 
		approach is to keep annual domestic spending low by building on the 
		savings that both parties agreed to last week.&nbsp; That step alone will 
		save us about $750 billion over 12 years.&nbsp; We will make the tough cuts 
		necessary to achieve these savings, including in programs that I care 
		deeply about, but I will not sacrifice the core investments that we need 
		to grow and create jobs.&nbsp; We will invest in medical research.&nbsp; We will 
		invest in clean energy technology.&nbsp; We will invest in new roads and 
		airports and broadband access.&nbsp; We will invest in education.&nbsp; We will 
		invest in job training.&nbsp; We will do what we need to do to compete, and 
		we will win the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second step in our 
		approach is to find additional savings in our defense budget.&nbsp; Now, as 
		Commander-in-Chief, I have no greater responsibility than protecting our 
		national security, and I will never accept cuts that compromise our 
		ability to defend our homeland or America’s interests around the world.&nbsp; 
		But as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mullen, has said, the 
		greatest long-term threat to America’s national security is America’s 
		debt.&nbsp; So just as we must find more savings in domestic programs, we 
		must do the same in defense.&nbsp; And we can do that while still keeping 
		ourselves safe.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over the last two years, 
		Secretary Bob Gates has courageously taken on wasteful spending, saving 
		$400 billion in current and future spending.&nbsp; I believe we can do that 
		again.&nbsp; We need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and 
		effectiveness, but we’re going to have to conduct a fundamental review 
		of America’s missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world.&nbsp; 
		I intend to work with Secretary Gates and the Joint Chiefs on this 
		review, and I will make specific decisions about spending after it’s 
		complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The third step in our 
		approach is to further reduce health care spending in our budget.&nbsp; Now, 
		here, the difference with the House Republican plan could not be 
		clearer.&nbsp; Their plan essentially lowers the government’s health care 
		bills by asking seniors and poor families to pay them instead.&nbsp; Our 
		approach lowers the government’s health care bills by reducing the cost 
		of health care itself.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Already, the reforms we 
		passed in the health care law will reduce our deficit by $1 trillion.&nbsp; 
		My approach would build on these reforms.&nbsp; We will reduce wasteful 
		subsidies and erroneous payments.&nbsp; We will cut spending on prescription 
		drugs by using Medicare’s purchasing power to drive greater efficiency 
		and speed generic brands of medicine onto the market.&nbsp; We will work with 
		governors of both parties to demand more efficiency and accountability 
		from Medicaid.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will change the way we 
		pay for health care -– not by the procedure or the number of days spent 
		in a hospital, but with new incentives for doctors and hospitals to 
		prevent injuries and improve results.&nbsp; And we will slow the growth of 
		Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission of doctors, 
		nurses, medical experts and consumers who will look at all the evidence 
		and recommend the best ways to reduce unnecessary spending while 
		protecting access to the services that seniors need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we believe the reforms 
		we’ve proposed to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid will enable us to 
		keep these commitments to our citizens while saving us $500 billion by 
		2023, and an additional $1 trillion in the decade after that.&nbsp; But if 
		we’re wrong, and Medicare costs rise faster than we expect, then this 
		approach will give the independent commission the authority to make 
		additional savings by further improving Medicare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But let me be absolutely 
		clear:&nbsp; I will preserve these health care programs as a promise we make 
		to each other in this society.&nbsp; I will not allow Medicare to become a 
		voucher program that leaves seniors at the mercy of the insurance 
		industry, with a shrinking benefit to pay for rising costs.&nbsp; I will not 
		tell families with children who have disabilities that they have to fend 
		for themselves.&nbsp; We will reform these programs, but we will not abandon 
		the fundamental commitment this country has kept for generations.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That includes, by the way, 
		our commitment to Social Security.&nbsp; While Social Security is not the 
		cause of our deficit, it faces real long-term challenges in a country 
		that’s growing older.&nbsp; As I said in the State of the Union, both parties 
		should work together now to strengthen Social Security for future 
		generations.&nbsp; But we have to do it without putting at risk current 
		retirees, or the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without 
		slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting 
		Americans’ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock 
		market.&nbsp; And it can be done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The fourth step in our 
		approach is to reduce spending in the tax code, so-called tax 
		expenditures.&nbsp; In December, I agreed to extend the tax cuts for the 
		wealthiest Americans because it was the only way I could prevent a tax 
		hike on middle-class Americans.&nbsp; But we cannot afford $1 trillion worth 
		of tax cuts for every millionaire and billionaire in our society.&nbsp; We 
		can’t afford it.&nbsp; And I refuse to renew them again.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Beyond that, the tax code is 
		also loaded up with spending on things like itemized deductions.&nbsp; And 
		while I agree with the goals of many of these deductions, from 
		homeownership to charitable giving, we can’t ignore the fact that they 
		provide millionaires an average tax break of $75,000 but do nothing for 
		the typical middle-class family that doesn’t itemize.&nbsp; So my budget 
		calls for limiting itemized deductions for the wealthiest 2 percent of 
		Americans -- a reform that would reduce the deficit by $320 billion over 
		10 years.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But to reduce the deficit, I 
		believe we should go further.&nbsp; And that’s why I’m calling on Congress to 
		reform our individual tax code so that it is fair and simple -- so that 
		the amount of taxes you pay isn’t determined by what kind of accountant 
		you can afford.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believe reform should 
		protect the middle class, promote economic growth, and build on the 
		fiscal commission’s model of reducing tax expenditures so that there’s 
		enough savings to both lower rates and lower the deficit.&nbsp; And as I 
		called for in the State of the Union, we should reform our corporate tax 
		code as well, to make our businesses and our economy more competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is my approach to 
		reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 12 years.&nbsp; It’s an 
		approach that achieves about $2 trillion in spending cuts across the 
		budget.&nbsp; It will lower our interest payments on the debt by $1 
		trillion.&nbsp; It calls for tax reform to cut about $1 trillion in tax 
		expenditures -- spending in the tax code.&nbsp; And it achieves these goals 
		while protecting the middle class, protecting our commitment to seniors, 
		and protecting our investments in the future.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, in the coming years, if 
		the recovery speeds up and our economy grows faster than our current 
		projections, we can make even greater progress than I’ve pledged here.&nbsp; 
		But just to hold Washington -- and to hold me --- accountable and make 
		sure that the debt burden continues to decline, my plan includes a debt 
		failsafe.&nbsp; If, by 2014, our debt is not projected to fall as a share of 
		the economy -– if we haven’t hit our targets, if Congress has failed to 
		act -– then my plan will require us to come together and make up the 
		additional savings with more spending cuts and more spending reductions 
		in the tax code.&nbsp; That should be an incentive for us to act boldly now, 
		instead of kicking our problems further down the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is our vision for 
		America -– this is my vision for America -- a vision where we live 
		within our means while still investing in our future; where everyone 
		makes sacrifices but no one bears all the burden; where we provide a 
		basic measure of security for our citizens and we provide rising 
		opportunity for our children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be those who 
		vigorously disagree with my approach.&nbsp; I can guarantee that as well.&nbsp; 
		Some will argue we should not even consider ever -- ever -- 
		raising taxes, even if only on the wealthiest Americans.&nbsp; It’s just an 
		article of faith to them.&nbsp; I say that at a time when the tax burden on 
		the wealthy is at its lowest level in half a century, the most fortunate 
		among us can afford to pay a little more.&nbsp; I don’t need another tax 
		cut.&nbsp; Warren Buffett doesn’t need another tax cut.&nbsp; Not if we have to 
		pay for it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.&nbsp; Or by cutting kids 
		from Head Start.&nbsp; Or by taking away college scholarships that I wouldn’t 
		be here without and that some of you would not be here without.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And here’s the thing:&nbsp; I 
		believe that most wealthy Americans would agree with me.&nbsp; They want to 
		give back to their country, a country that’s done so much for them.&nbsp; 
		It’s just Washington hasn’t asked them to.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Others will say that we 
		shouldn’t even talk about cutting spending until the economy is fully 
		recovered.&nbsp; These are mostly folks in my party.&nbsp; I’m sympathetic to this 
		view -- which is one of the reasons I supported the payroll tax cuts we 
		passed in December.&nbsp; It’s also why we have to use a scalpel and not a 
		machete to reduce the deficit, so that we can keep making the 
		investments that create jobs.&nbsp; But doing nothing on the deficit is just 
		not an option.&nbsp; Our debt has grown so large that we could do real damage 
		to the economy if we don’t begin a process now to get our fiscal house 
		in order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, there are those who 
		believe we shouldn’t make any reforms to Medicare, Medicaid, or Social 
		Security, out of fear that any talk of change to these programs will 
		immediately usher in the sort of steps that the House Republicans have 
		proposed.&nbsp; And I understand those fears.&nbsp; But I guarantee that if we 
		don’t make any changes at all, we won’t be able to keep our commitment 
		to a retiring generation that will live longer and will face higher 
		health care costs than those who came before.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Indeed, to those in my own 
		party, I say that if we truly believe in a progressive vision of our 
		society, we have an obligation to prove that we can afford our 
		commitments.&nbsp; If we believe the government can make a difference in 
		people’s lives, we have the obligation to prove that it works -– by 
		making government smarter, and leaner and more effective.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, there are those 
		who simply say there’s no way we can come together at all and agree on a 
		solution to this challenge.&nbsp; They’ll say the politics of this city are 
		just too broken; the choices are just too hard; the parties are just too 
		far apart.&nbsp; And after a few years on this job, I have some sympathy for 
		this view.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I also know that we’ve 
		come together before and met big challenges.&nbsp; Ronald Reagan and Tip 
		O’Neill came together to save Social Security for future generations.&nbsp; 
		The first President Bush and a Democratic Congress came together to 
		reduce the deficit.&nbsp; President Clinton and a Republican Congress battled 
		each other ferociously, disagreed on just about everything, but they 
		still found a way to balance the budget.&nbsp; And in the last few months, 
		both parties have come together to pass historic tax relief and spending 
		cuts.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I know there are 
		Republicans and Democrats in Congress who want to see a balanced 
		approach to deficit reduction.&nbsp; And even those Republicans I disagree 
		with most strongly I believe are sincere about wanting to do right by 
		their country.&nbsp; We may disagree on our visions, but I truly believe they 
		want to do the right thing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I believe we can, and 
		must, come together again.&nbsp; This morning, I met with Democratic and 
		Republican leaders in Congress to discuss the approach that I laid out 
		today.&nbsp; And in early May, the Vice President will begin regular meetings 
		with leaders in both parties with the aim of reaching a final agreement 
		on a plan to reduce the deficit and get it done by the end of June.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t expect the details 
		in any final agreement to look exactly like the approach I laid out 
		today.&nbsp; This a democracy; that’s not how things work.&nbsp; I’m eager to hear 
		other ideas from all ends of the political spectrum.&nbsp; And though I’m 
		sure the criticism of what I’ve said here today will be fierce in some 
		quarters, and my critique of the House Republican approach has been 
		strong, Americans deserve and will demand that we all make an effort to 
		bridge our differences and find common ground.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This larger debate that 
		we’re having -- this larger debate about the size and the role of 
		government -- it has been with us since our founding days.&nbsp; And during 
		moments of great challenge and change, like the one that we’re living 
		through now, the debate gets sharper and it gets more vigorous.&nbsp; That’s 
		not a bad thing.&nbsp; In fact, it’s a good thing.&nbsp; As a country that prizes 
		both our individual freedom and our obligations to one another, this is 
		one of the most important debates that we can have.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But no matter what we argue, 
		no matter where we stand, we’ve always held certain beliefs as 
		Americans.&nbsp; We believe that in order to preserve our own freedoms and 
		pursue our own happiness, we can’t just think about ourselves.&nbsp; We have 
		to think about the country that made these liberties possible.&nbsp; We have 
		to think about our fellow citizens with whom we share a community.&nbsp; And 
		we have to think about what’s required to preserve the American Dream 
		for future generations.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This sense of responsibility 
		-- to each other and to our country -- this isn’t a partisan feeling.&nbsp; 
		It isn’t a Democratic or a Republican idea.&nbsp; It’s patriotism.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The other day I received a 
		letter from a man in Florida.&nbsp; He started off by telling me he didn’t 
		vote for me and he hasn’t always agreed with me.&nbsp; But even though he’s 
		worried about our economy and the state of our politics -- here’s what 
		he said -- he said, “I still believe.&nbsp; I believe in that great country 
		that my grandfather told me about.&nbsp; I believe that somewhere lost in 
		this quagmire of petty bickering on every news station, the ‘American 
		Dream’ is still alive…We need to use our dollars here rebuilding, 
		refurbishing and restoring all that our ancestors struggled to create 
		and maintain… We as a people must do this together, no matter the color 
		of the state one comes from or the side of the aisle one might sit on.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">“I still believe.”&nbsp; I still 
		believe as well.&nbsp; And I know that if we can come together and uphold our 
		responsibilities to one another and to this larger enterprise that is 
		America, we will keep the dream of our founding alive -- in our time; 
		and we will pass it on to our children.&nbsp; We will pass on to our children 
		a country that we believe in.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp; God bless you, 
		and may God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
