<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is great to be here in 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Stadium">
		<font color="#0000FF">The Big House</font></a> -- and so may I say, “Go Blue!”&nbsp;I thought I’d go for the 
		cheap applause line to start things off.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good afternoon, President 
		Coleman, the Board of Trustees, to faculty, parents, family and friends 
		of the class of 2010.&nbsp; Congratulations on your graduation, and thank you 
		for allowing me the honor of being a part of it.&nbsp; Let me acknowledge 
		your wonderful governor, Jennifer Granholm; your mayor, John Hieftje; 
		and all the members of Congress who are here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is a privilege to be with 
		you on this happy occasion, and, you know, it’s nice to spend a little 
		time outside of Washington.&nbsp;Now, don’t get me wrong -- Washington is a 
		beautiful city.&nbsp; It’s very nice living above the store; you can’t beat 
		the commute.&nbsp; It’s just sometimes all you hear in Washington is the 
		clamor of politics.&nbsp; And all that noise can drown out the voices of the 
		people who sent you there.&nbsp; So when I took office, I decided that each 
		night I would read 10 letters out of the tens of thousands that are sent 
		to us by ordinary Americans every day -- this is my modest effort to 
		remind myself of why I ran in the first place.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of these letters tell 
		stories of heartache and struggle.&nbsp; Some express gratitude, some express 
		anger.&nbsp; I'd say a good solid third call me an idiot -- which is how I 
		know that I’m getting a good, representative sample.&nbsp; Some of the 
		letters make you think -- like the one that I received last month from a 
		kindergarten class in Virginia.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the teacher of this 
		class instructed the students to ask me any question they wanted.&nbsp; So 
		one asked, “How do you do your job?”&nbsp; Another asked, “Do you work a 
		lot?”&nbsp; Somebody wanted to know if I wear a black jacket or if I have a 
		beard -- so clearly they were getting me mixed up with the other tall 
		guy from Illinois.&nbsp;And one of my favorites was from a kid who wanted to 
		know if I lived next to a volcano.&nbsp; I'm still trying to piece the 
		thought process on this one.&nbsp; Loved this letter.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But it was the last question 
		from the last student in the letter that gave me pause.&nbsp; The student 
		asked, “Are people being nice?”&nbsp; Are people being nice?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, if you turn on the 
		news today, or yesterday, or a week ago, or a month ago -- particularly 
		one of the cable channels -- you can see why even a kindergartener would 
		ask this question.&nbsp; We’ve got politicians calling each other all sorts 
		of unflattering names.&nbsp; Pundits and talking heads shout at each other.&nbsp; 
		The media tends to play up every hint of conflict, because it makes for 
		a sexier story -- which means anyone interested in getting coverage 
		feels compelled to make their arguments as outrageous and as incendiary 
		as possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, some of this 
		contentiousness can be attributed to the incredibly difficult moment in 
		which we find ourselves as a nation.&nbsp; The fact is, when you leave here 
		today you will search for work in an economy that is still emerging from 
		the worst crisis since the Great Depression.&nbsp; You live in a century 
		where the speed with which jobs and industries move across the globe is 
		forcing America to compete like never before.&nbsp; You will raise your 
		children at a time when threats like terrorism and climate change aren’t 
		confined within the borders of any one country.&nbsp; And as our world grows 
		smaller and more connected, you will live and work with more people who 
		don’t look like you or think like you or come from where you do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I really enjoyed Alex’s 
		remarks because that's a lot of change.&nbsp; And all these changes, all 
		these challenges, inevitably cause some tension in the body politic.&nbsp; 
		They make people worry about the future and sometimes they get people 
		riled up.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I think it’s important 
		that we maintain some historic perspective.&nbsp; Since the days of our 
		founding, American politics has never been a particularly nice business.&nbsp; 
		It’s always been a little less gentile during times of great change.&nbsp; 
		A newspaper of the opposing party once editorialized that if Thomas 
		Jefferson were elected, “Murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest 
		will be openly taught and practiced.”&nbsp; Not subtle.&nbsp; Opponents 
		of Andrew Jackson often referred to his mother as a “common prostitute,” 
		which seems a little over the top.&nbsp; Presidents from Teddy Roosevelt 
		to Lyndon Johnson have been accused of promoting socialism, or worse.&nbsp; 
		And we’ve had arguments between politicians that have been settled with 
		actual duels.&nbsp; There was even a caning once on the floor of the 
		United States Senate -- which I’m happy to say didn’t happen while I was 
		there.&nbsp;It was a few years before.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The point is, politics has 
		never been for the thin-skinned or the faint-of-heart, and if you enter 
		the arena, you should expect to get roughed up.&nbsp; Moreover, democracy in 
		a nation of more than 300 million people is inherently difficult.&nbsp; It’s 
		always been noisy and messy, contentious, complicated.&nbsp; We’ve been 
		fighting about the proper size and role of government since the day the 
		Framers gathered in Philadelphia.&nbsp; We’ve battled over the meaning of 
		individual freedom and equality since the Bill of Rights was drafted.&nbsp; 
		As our economy has shifted emphasis from agriculture to industry, to 
		information, to technology, we have argued and struggled at each and 
		every juncture over the best way to ensure that all of our citizens have 
		a shot at opportunity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So before we get too 
		depressed about the current state of our politics, let’s remember our 
		history.&nbsp; The great debates of the past all stirred great passions.&nbsp; 
		They all made somebody angry, and at least once led to a terrible war.&nbsp; 
		What is amazing is that despite all the conflict, despite all its flaws 
		and its frustrations, our experiment in democracy has worked better than 
		any form of government on Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the last day of the 
		Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was famously asked, “Well, 
		Doctor, what have we got -- a republic or a monarchy?”&nbsp; And Franklin 
		gave an answer that’s been quoted for ages:&nbsp; He said, “A republic, if 
		you can keep it.”&nbsp; If you can keep it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, for more than 200 
		years, we have kept it.&nbsp; Through revolution and civil war, our democracy 
		has survived.&nbsp; Through depression and world war, it has prevailed.&nbsp; 
		Through periods of great social and economic unrest, from civil rights 
		to women’s rights, it has allowed us slowly, sometimes painfully, to 
		move towards <a href="../barackobamaperfectunion.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">a more perfect union</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so now, class of 2010, 
		the question for your generation is this:&nbsp; How will you keep our 
		democracy going?&nbsp; At a moment when our challenges seem so big and our 
		politics seem so small, how will you keep our democracy alive and 
		vibrant; how will you keep it well in this century?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’m not here to offer some 
		grand theory or detailed policy prescription.&nbsp; But let me offer a few 
		brief reflections based on my own experiences and the experiences of our 
		country over the last two centuries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First of all, American 
		democracy has thrived because we have recognized the need for a 
		government that, while limited, can still help us adapt to a changing 
		world.&nbsp; On the fourth panel of the Jefferson Memorial is a quote I 
		remember reading to my daughters during our first visit there.&nbsp; It says, 
		“I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, 
		but...with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also 
		to keep pace with the times.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The democracy designed by 
		Jefferson and the other founders was never intended to solve every 
		problem with a new law or a new program.&nbsp; Having thrown off the tyranny 
		of the British Empire, the first Americans were understandably skeptical 
		of government. And ever since we’ve held fast to the belief that 
		government doesn’t have all the answers, and we have cherished and 
		fiercely defended our individual freedom.&nbsp; That’s a strand of our 
		nation’s DNA.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the other strand is the 
		belief that there are some things we can only do together, as one nation 
		-- and that our government must keep pace with the times.&nbsp; When America 
		expanded from a few colonies to an entire continent, and we needed a way 
		to reach the Pacific, our government helped build the railroads. When we 
		transitioned from an economy based on farms to one based on factories, 
		and workers needed new skills and training, our nation set up a system 
		of public high schools.&nbsp; When the markets crashed during the Depression 
		and people lost their life savings, our government put in place a set of 
		rules and safeguards to make sure that such a crisis never happened 
		again, and then put a safety net in place to make sure that our elders 
		would never be impoverished the way they had been.&nbsp; And because our 
		markets and financial systems have evolved since then, we’re now putting 
		in place new rules and safeguards to protect the American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this notion -- this 
		notion, class, hasn’t always been partisan.&nbsp; It was the first Republican 
		President, Abraham Lincoln, who said the role of government is to do for 
		the people what they cannot do better for themselves.&nbsp; And he’d go on to 
		begin that first intercontinental railroad and set up the first 
		land-grant colleges.&nbsp; It was another Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, who 
		said, “the object of government is the welfare of the people.”&nbsp; And he’s 
		remembered for using the power of government to break up monopolies, and 
		establish our National Park system.&nbsp; Democrat Lyndon Johnson announced 
		<a href="../lbjthegreatsociety.htm"><font color="#0000FF">the Great Society during a commencement here at Michigan</font></a>, but it was the 
		Republican President before him, Dwight Eisenhower, who launched the 
		massive government undertaking known as the Interstate Highway System.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, there have always 
		been those who’ve opposed such efforts.&nbsp; They argue government 
		intervention is usually inefficient; that it restricts individual 
		freedom and dampens individual initiative.&nbsp; And in certain instances, 
		that’s been true.&nbsp; For many years, we had a welfare system that too 
		often discouraged people from taking responsibility for their own upward 
		mobility.&nbsp; At times, we’ve neglected the role of parents, rather than 
		government, in cultivating a child’s education.&nbsp; And sometimes 
		regulation fails, and sometimes their benefits don’t justify their 
		costs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But what troubles me is when 
		I hear people say that all of government is inherently bad.&nbsp; One of my 
		favorite signs during the health care debate was somebody who said, 
		“Keep Your Government Hands Out Of My Medicare” -- which is essentially 
		saying “Keep Government Out Of My Government-Run Health Care Plan.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When our government is 
		spoken of as some menacing, threatening foreign entity, it ignores the 
		fact that in our democracy, government is us.&nbsp; We, the people -- We, the 
		people, hold in our hands the power to choose our leaders and change our 
		laws, and shape our own destiny.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Government is the police 
		officers who are protecting our communities, and the servicemen and 
		women who are defending us abroad.&nbsp; Government is the roads you drove in 
		on and the speed limits that kept you safe.&nbsp; Government is what ensures 
		that mines adhere to safety standards and that oil spills are cleaned up 
		by the companies that caused them.&nbsp; Government is this extraordinary 
		public university -- a place that’s doing lifesaving research, and 
		catalyzing economic growth, and graduating students who will change the 
		world around them in ways big and small.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The truth is, the debate 
		we’ve had for decades now between more government and less government, 
		it doesn’t really fit the times in which we live.&nbsp; We know that too much 
		government can stifle competition and deprive us of choice and burden us 
		with debt.&nbsp; But we’ve also clearly seen the dangers of too little 
		government -- like when a lack of accountability on Wall Street nearly 
		leads to the collapse of our entire economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, class of 2010, what we 
		should be asking is not whether we need “big government” or a “small 
		government,” but how we can create a smarter and better government.&nbsp; 
		Because in an era of iPods and Tivo, where we have more choices than 
		ever before -- even though I can't really work a lot of these things&nbsp; -- 
		but I have 23-year-olds who do it for me -- government shouldn’t try to 
		dictate your lives.&nbsp; But it should give you the tools you need to 
		succeed.&nbsp; Government shouldn’t try to guarantee results, but it should 
		guarantee a shot at opportunity for every American who’s willing to work 
		hard.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So -- So, yes, we can and should 
		debate the role of government in our lives.&nbsp; But remember, as you are 
		asked to meet the challenges of our time, remember that the ability for 
		us to adapt our government to the needs of the age has helped make our 
		democracy work since its inception.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the second way to keep 
		our democracy healthy is to maintain a basic level of civility in our 
		public debate.&nbsp;These arguments we’re having over government and health 
		care and war and taxes -- these are serious arguments.&nbsp; They should 
		arouse people’s passions, and it’s important for everybody to join in 
		the debate, with all the vigor that the maintenance of a free people 
		requires.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we can’t expect to solve 
		our problems if all we do is tear each other down.&nbsp; You can disagree 
		with a certain policy without demonizing the person who espouses it.&nbsp; 
		You can question somebody’s views and their judgment without questioning 
		their motives or their patriotism.&nbsp; Throwing around phrases like 
		“socialists” and “Soviet-style takeover” and “fascist” and “right-wing 
		nut” -- that may grab headlines, but it also has the effect of comparing 
		our government, our political opponents, to authoritarian, even 
		murderous regimes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we’ve seen this kind of 
		politics in the past.&nbsp; It’s been practiced by both fringes of the 
		ideological spectrum, by the left and the right, since our nation’s 
		birth.&nbsp; But it’s starting to creep into the center of our discourse.&nbsp; 
		And the problem with it is not the hurt feelings or the bruised egos of 
		the public officials who are criticized.&nbsp; Remember, they signed up for 
		it.&nbsp; Michelle always reminds me of that.&nbsp;The problem is that this kind 
		of vilification and over-the-top rhetoric closes the door to the 
		possibility of compromise.&nbsp; It undermines democratic deliberation.&nbsp; It 
		prevents learning -- since, after all, why should we listen to a 
		“fascist,” or a “socialist,” or a “right-wing nut,” or a left-wing nut”?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It makes it nearly 
		impossible for people who have legitimate but bridgeable differences to 
		sit down at the same table and hash things out.&nbsp; It robs us of a 
		rational and serious debate, the one we need to have about the very real 
		and very big challenges facing this nation.&nbsp; It coarsens our culture, 
		and at its worst, it can send signals to the most extreme elements of 
		our society that perhaps violence is a justifiable response.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what do we do?&nbsp; As I 
		found out after a year in the White House, changing this type of 
		politics is not easy.&nbsp; And part of what civility requires is that we 
		recall the simple lesson most of us learned from our parents:&nbsp; Treat 
		others as you would like to be treated, with courtesy and respect.&nbsp; But 
		civility in this age also requires something more than just asking if we 
		can’t just all get along.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today’s 24/7 echo-chamber 
		amplifies the most inflammatory soundbites louder and faster than ever 
		before.&nbsp; And it’s also, however, given us unprecedented choice.&nbsp; Whereas 
		most Americans used to get their news from the same three networks over 
		dinner, or a few influential papers on Sunday morning, we now have the 
		option to get our information from any number of blogs or websites or 
		cable news shows.&nbsp; And this can have both a good and bad development for 
		democracy.&nbsp; For if we choose only to expose ourselves to opinions and 
		viewpoints that are in line with our own, studies suggest that we become 
		more polarized, more set in our ways.&nbsp; That will only reinforce and even 
		deepen the political divides in this country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But if we choose to actively 
		seek out information that challenges our assumptions and our beliefs, 
		perhaps we can begin to understand where the people who disagree with us 
		are coming from.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this requires us to 
		agree on a certain set of facts to debate from.&nbsp; That’s why we need a 
		vibrant and thriving news business that is separate from opinion makers 
		and talking heads. That’s why we need an educated citizenry that values 
		hard evidence and not just assertion.&nbsp; As Senator Daniel Patrick 
		Moynihan famously once said, “Everybody is entitled to his own opinion, 
		but not his own facts.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Still, if you’re somebody who only reads the editorial page of The New 
		York Times, try glancing at the 
		<a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-opinion-commentary.html">
		<font color="#0000FF">[Opinion] page of The Wall Street Journal</font></a> once in 
		a while.&nbsp; If you’re a fan of Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, try reading a 
		few columns on the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">
		<font color="#0000FF">Huffington Post website</font></a>.&nbsp; It may 
		<a href="../../MovieSpeeches/moviespeechtheamericanpresident.html">
		<font color="#0000FF">make your blood 
		boil</font></a>; your mind may not be changed.&nbsp; But the practice of listening to 
		opposing views is essential for effective citizenship.&nbsp;It is essential 
		for our democracy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so, too, is the practice 
		of engaging in different experiences with different kinds of people.&nbsp; I 
		look out at this class and I realize for four years at Michigan you have 
		been exposed to diverse thinkers and scholars, professors and students.&nbsp; 
		Don’t narrow that broad intellectual exposure just because you’re 
		leaving here.&nbsp; Instead, seek to expand it.&nbsp; If you grew up in a big 
		city, spend some time with somebody who grew up in a rural town.&nbsp; If you 
		find yourself only hanging around with people of your own race or 
		ethnicity or religion, include people in your circle who have different 
		backgrounds and life experiences.&nbsp; You’ll learn what it’s like to walk 
		in somebody else’s shoes, and in the process, you will help to make this 
		democracy work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Which brings me to the last 
		ingredient in a functioning democracy, one that's perhaps most basic -- 
		and it’s already been mentioned -- and that is participation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Class of 2010, I understand 
		that one effect of today’s poisonous political climate is to push people 
		away from participation in public life.&nbsp; If all you see when you turn on 
		the TV is name-calling, if all you hear about is how special interest 
		lobbying and partisanship prevented Washington from getting something 
		done, you might think to yourself, “What’s the point of getting 
		involved?”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here’s the point.&nbsp; When we 
		don’t pay close attention to the decisions made by our leaders, when we 
		fail to educate ourselves about the major issues of the day, when we 
		choose not to make our voices and opinions heard, that’s when democracy 
		breaks down.&nbsp; That’s when power is abused.&nbsp; That’s when the most extreme 
		voices in our society fill the void that we leave.&nbsp; That’s when powerful 
		interests and their lobbyists are most able to buy access and influence 
		in the corridors of power -- because none of us are there to speak up 
		and stop them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Participation in public life 
		doesn’t mean that you all have to run for public office -- though we 
		could certainly use some fresh faces in Washington.&nbsp;But it does mean 
		that you should pay attention and contribute in any way that you can.&nbsp; 
		Stay informed.&nbsp; Write letters, or make phone calls on behalf of an issue 
		you care about.&nbsp; If electoral politics isn’t your thing, continue the 
		tradition so many of you started here at Michigan and find a way to 
		serve your community and your country -- an act that will help you stay 
		connected to your fellow citizens and improve the lives of those around 
		you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was 50 years ago that a 
		young candidate for president came here to Michigan and delivered a 
		speech that inspired one of the most successful service projects in 
		American history.&nbsp; And as John F. Kennedy described the 
		<a href="../jfkpeacecorpsexecutiveorder.htm"><font color="#0000FF">ideals behind 
		what would become the Peace Corps</font></a>, he issued a challenge to the students 
		who had assembled in Ann Arbor on that October night:&nbsp; “on your 
		willingness to contribute part of your life to this country,” he said, 
		will depend the answer whether a free society can compete. I think it 
		can,” he said.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This democracy we have is a 
		precious thing.&nbsp; For all the arguments and all the doubts and all the 
		cynicism that’s out there today, we should never forget that as 
		Americans, we enjoy more freedoms and opportunities than citizens in any 
		other nation on Earth.&nbsp; We are free to speak our mind and worship as we 
		please.&nbsp; We are free to choose our leaders, and criticize them if they 
		let us down.&nbsp; We have the chance to get an education, and work hard, and 
		give our children a better life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">None of this came easy.&nbsp; 
		None of this was preordained.&nbsp; The men and women who sat in your chairs 
		10 years ago and 50 years ago and 100 years ago -- they made America 
		possible through their toil and their endurance and their imagination 
		and their faith.&nbsp; Their success, and America’s success, was never a 
		given.&nbsp; And there is no guarantee that the graduates who will sit in 
		these same seats 10 years from now, or 50 years from now, or 100 years 
		from now, will enjoy the same freedoms and opportunities that you do.&nbsp; 
		You, too, will have to strive.&nbsp; You, too, will have to push the 
		boundaries of what seems possible.&nbsp; For the truth is, our nation’s 
		destiny has never been certain.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What is certain -- what has 
		always been certain -- is the ability to shape that destiny.&nbsp; That is 
		what makes us different. That is what sets us apart.&nbsp; That is what makes 
		us Americans -- our ability at the end of the day to look past all of 
		our differences and all of our disagreements and still forge a common 
		future.&nbsp; That task is now in your hands, as is the answer to the 
		question posed at this university half a century ago about whether a 
		free society can still compete.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you are willing, as past 
		generations were willing, to contribute part of your life to the life of 
		this country, then I, like President Kennedy, believe we can.&nbsp; Because I 
		believe in you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Congratulations on your 
		graduation, 2010.&nbsp; May God bless you, and may God bless the United 
		States of America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.</font></p>
