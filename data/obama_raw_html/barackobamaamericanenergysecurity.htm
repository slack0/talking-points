transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It 
		is wonderful to be back at Georgetown.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've got a number of 
		acknowledgements.&nbsp; First of all, I just want to thank President DeGioia 
		for his outstanding leadership here, but also for his hospitality.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also have here Secretary 
		Steven Chu, my Energy Secretary. Where is Steven?&nbsp; There he is over 
		there.&nbsp;Secretary Ken Salazar of the Interior Department.&nbsp; Secretary Tom 
		Vilsack, our Agriculture Secretary.&nbsp;Ray LaHood, our Transportation 
		Secretary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa Jackson, our EPA Administrator.&nbsp;Nancy Sutley, who is our Council on Environmental Quality director, right 
		here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A couple of great members of 
		Congress -- Congressman Jay Inslee of Washington.&nbsp; Where’s Jay?&nbsp; There 
		he is over there.&nbsp; And Rush Holt of New Jersey is here.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've got 
		-- he didn’t bring the weather with him -- but the mayor of Los Angeles, 
		Antonio Villaraigosa, is in the house.&nbsp; Mayor Scott Smith of Mesa, 
		Arizona, is here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And most importantly, the 
		students of Georgetown University are in the house.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to start with a 
		difficult subject:&nbsp; The Hoyas had a tough loss, Coach.&nbsp; Coach is here, 
		too, and I love Coach Thompson.&nbsp; I love his dad and the great tradition 
		that they’ve had.&nbsp; And it turned out VCU was pretty good.&nbsp; I had 
		Georgetown winning that game in my bracket, so we’re all hurting here.&nbsp; 
		But that's what next year is for.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We meet here at a tumultuous 
		time for the world.&nbsp; In a matter of months, we’ve seen regimes toppled.&nbsp; 
		We've seen democracy take root in North Africa and in the Middle East.&nbsp; 
		We’ve witnessed a terrible earthquake, a catastrophic tsunami, a nuclear 
		emergency that has battered one of our strongest allies and closest 
		friends in the world’s third-largest economy.&nbsp; We’ve led an 
		international effort in Libya to prevent a massacre and maintain 
		stability throughout the broader region.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as Americans, we’re 
		heartbroken by the lives that have been lost as a result of these 
		events.&nbsp; We’re deeply moved by the thirst for freedom in so many 
		nations, and we’re moved by the strength and the perseverance of the 
		Japanese people.&nbsp; And it’s natural, I think, to feel anxious about what 
		all of this means for us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And one big area of concern 
		has been the cost and security of our energy.&nbsp; Obviously, the situation 
		in the Middle East implicates our energy security.&nbsp; The situation in 
		Japan leads us to ask questions about our energy sources.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In an economy that relies so 
		heavily on oil, rising prices at the pump affect everybody -- workers, 
		farmers, truck drivers, restaurant owners, students who are lucky enough 
		to have a car.&nbsp;Businesses see rising prices at the pump hurt their 
		bottom line.&nbsp; Families feel the pinch when they fill up their tank.&nbsp; And 
		for Americans that are already struggling to get by, a hike in gas 
		prices really makes their lives that much harder.&nbsp; It hurts.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you’re somebody who works 
		in a relatively low-wage job and you’ve got to commute to work, it takes 
		up a big chunk of your income.&nbsp; You may not be able to buy as many 
		groceries.&nbsp; You may have to cut back on medicines in order to fill up 
		the gas tank.&nbsp; So this is something that everybody is affected by.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, here’s the thing -- we 
		have been down this road before. Remember, it was just three years ago 
		that gas prices topped $4 a gallon.&nbsp; I remember because I was in the 
		middle of a presidential campaign.&nbsp; Working folks certainly remember 
		because it hit a lot of people pretty hard.&nbsp; And because we were at the 
		height of political season, you had all kinds of slogans and gimmicks 
		and outraged politicians -- they were waving their three-point plans for 
		$2 a gallon gas.&nbsp; You remember that -- “drill, baby, drill”<br>
		-- and we were going through all that.&nbsp; And none of it was really going 
		to do anything to solve the problem.&nbsp; There was a lot of hue and cry, a 
		lot of fulminating and hand-wringing, but nothing actually happened.&nbsp; 
		Imagine that in Washington.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The truth is, none of these 
		gimmicks, none of these slogans made a bit of difference.&nbsp; When gas 
		prices finally did fall, it was mostly because the global recession had 
		led to less demand for oil.&nbsp; Companies were producing less; the demand 
		for petroleum went down; prices went down.&nbsp; Now that the economy is 
		recovering, demand is back up.&nbsp; Add the turmoil in the Middle East, and 
		it’s not surprising that oil prices are higher.&nbsp; And every time the 
		price of a barrel of oil on the world market rises by $10, a gallon of 
		gas goes up by about 25 cents.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The point is the ups and 
		downs in gas prices historically have tended to be temporary.&nbsp; But when 
		you look at the long-term trends, there are going to be more ups in gas 
		prices than downs in gas prices.&nbsp; And that’s because you’ve got 
		countries like India and China that are growing at a rapid clip, and as 
		2 billion more people start consuming more goods -- they want cars just 
		like we’ve got cars; they want to use energy to make their lives a 
		little easier just like we’ve got -- it is absolutely certain that 
		demand will go up a lot faster than supply.&nbsp; It’s just a fact.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So here’s the bottom line:&nbsp; 
		There are no quick fixes.&nbsp; Anybody who tells you otherwise isn’t telling 
		you the truth.&nbsp; And we will keep on being a victim to shifts in the oil 
		market until we finally get serious about a long-term policy for a 
		secure, affordable energy future.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamageorgetownenergy3.jpg" width="192" height="178">
		</font>
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re going to have to think 
		long term, which is why I came here, to talk to young people here at 
		Georgetown, because you have more of a stake in us getting our energy 
		policy right than just about anybody.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, here’s a source of 
		concern, though.&nbsp; We’ve known about the dangers of our oil dependence 
		for decades.&nbsp; Richard Nixon talked about freeing ourselves from 
		dependence on foreign oil.&nbsp; And every President since that time has 
		talked about freeing ourselves from dependence on foreign oil.&nbsp; 
		Politicians of every stripe have promised energy independence, but that 
		promise has so far gone unmet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I talked about reducing 
		America’s dependence on oil when I was running for President, and I’m 
		proud of the historic progress that we’ve made over the last two years 
		towards that goal, and we’ll talk about that a little bit.&nbsp; But I’ve got 
		to be honest.&nbsp; We’ve run into the same political gridlock, the same 
		inertia that has held us back for decades.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That has to change.&nbsp; That 
		has to change.&nbsp; We cannot keep going from shock when gas prices go up to 
		trance when they go back down -- we go back to doing the same things 
		we’ve been doing until the next time there’s a price spike, and then 
		we’re shocked again.&nbsp; We can’t rush to propose action when gas prices 
		are high and then hit the snooze button when they fall again.&nbsp; We can’t 
		keep on doing that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The United States of America 
		cannot afford to bet our long-term prosperity, our long-term security on 
		a resource that will eventually run out, and even before it runs out 
		will get more and more expensive to extract from the ground.&nbsp; We can’t 
		afford it when the costs to our economy, our country, and our planet are 
		so high.&nbsp; Not when your generation needs us to get this right.&nbsp; It’s 
		time to do what we can to secure our energy future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And today, I want to 
		announce a new goal, one that is reasonable, one that is achievable, and 
		one that is necessary.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I was elected to this 
		office, America imported 11 million barrels of oil a day.&nbsp; By a little 
		more than a decade from now, we will have cut that by one-third.&nbsp; That 
		is something that we can achieve.&nbsp;We can cut our oil dependence -- we 
		can cut our oil dependence by a third.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I set this goal knowing that 
		we’re still going to have to import some oil.&nbsp; It will remain an 
		important part of our energy portfolio for quite some time, until we’ve 
		gotten alternative energy strategies fully in force.&nbsp; And when it comes 
		to the oil we import from other nations, obviously we’ve got to look at 
		neighbors like Canada and Mexico that are stable and steady and reliable 
		sources.&nbsp; We also have to look at other countries like Brazil.&nbsp; Part of 
		the reason I went down there is to talk about energy with the 
		Brazilians.&nbsp; They recently discovered significant new oil reserves, and 
		we can share American technology and know-how with them as they develop 
		these resources.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But our best opportunities 
		to enhance our energy security can be found in our own backyard -- 
		because we boast one critical, renewable resource that the rest of the 
		world can’t match:&nbsp; American ingenuity.&nbsp; American ingenuity, American 
		know-how.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To make ourselves more 
		secure, to control our energy future, we’re going to have to harness all 
		of that ingenuity.&nbsp; It’s a task we won’t be finished with by the end of 
		my presidency, or even by the end of the next presidency.&nbsp; But if we 
		continue the work that we’ve already begun over the last two years, we 
		won’t just spark new jobs, industries and innovations -- we will leave 
		your generation and future generations with a country that is safer, 
		that is healthier, and that’s more prosperous.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today, my administration 
		is releasing a Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future that outlines a 
		comprehensive national energy policy, one that we’ve been pursuing since 
		the day I took office.&nbsp; And cutting our oil dependence by a third is 
		part of that plan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here at Georgetown, I’d like 
		to talk in broad strokes about how we can achieve these goals.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, meeting the goal of 
		cutting our oil dependence depends largely on two things:&nbsp; first, 
		finding and producing more oil at home; second, reducing our overall 
		dependence on oil with cleaner alternative fuels and greater efficiency.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This begins by continuing to 
		increase America’s oil supply. Even for those of you who are interested 
		in seeing a reduction in our dependence on fossil fuels -- and I know 
		how passionate young people are about issues like climate change -- the 
		fact of the matter is, is that for quite some time, America is going to 
		be still dependent on oil in making its economy work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, last year, American oil 
		production reached its highest level since 2003.&nbsp; And for the first time 
		in more than a decade, oil we imported accounted for less than half of 
		the liquid fuel we consumed.&nbsp; So that was a good trend.&nbsp; To keep 
		reducing that reliance on imports, my administration is encouraging 
		offshore oil exploration and production -- as long as it’s safe and 
		responsible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t think anybody here 
		has forgotten what happened last year, where we had to deal with the 
		largest oil spill in [our] history. I know some of the fishermen down in 
		the Gulf Coast haven’t forgotten it.&nbsp; And what we learned from that 
		disaster helped us put in place smarter standards of safety and 
		responsibility.&nbsp; For example, if you’re going to drill in deepwater, 
		you’ve got to prove before you start drilling that you can actually 
		contain an underwater spill.&nbsp; That’s just common sense.&nbsp; And lately, 
		we’ve been hearing folks saying, well, the Obama administration, they 
		put restrictions on how oil companies operate offshore.&nbsp; Well, yes, 
		because we just spent all that time, energy and money trying to clean up 
		a big mess.&nbsp; And I don't know about you, but I don't have amnesia.&nbsp; I 
		remember these things.&nbsp;And I think it was important for us to make sure 
		that we prevent something like that from happening again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, today, we’re working to 
		expedite new drilling permits for companies that meet these higher 
		standards.&nbsp; Since they were put in, we’ve approved 39 new shallow-water 
		permits; we’ve approved seven deepwater permits in recent weeks.&nbsp; When 
		it comes to drilling offshore, my administration approved more than two 
		permits last year for every new well that the industry started to 
		drill.&nbsp; So any claim that my administration is responsible for gas 
		prices because we’ve “shut down” oil production, any claim like that is 
		simply untrue.&nbsp; It might make for a useful sound bite, but it doesn’t 
		track with reality.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What is true is we’ve said 
		if you’re going to drill offshore you’ve got to have a plan to make sure 
		that we don’t have the kind of catastrophe that we had last year.&nbsp; And I 
		don’t think that there’s anybody who should dispute that that’s the 
		right strategy to pursue.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, we’re actually 
		pushing the oil industry to take advantage of the opportunities that 
		they’ve already got.&nbsp; Right now the industry holds tens of millions of 
		acres of leases where they’re not producing a single drop.&nbsp; They’re just 
		sitting on supplies of American energy that are ready to be tapped.&nbsp; 
		That’s why part of our plan is to provide new and better incentives that 
		promote rapid, responsible development of these resources.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re also exploring and 
		assessing new frontiers for oil and gas development from Alaska to the 
		Mid- and South Atlantic states, because producing more oil in America 
		can help lower oil prices, can help create jobs, and can enhance our 
		energy security, but we’ve got to do it in the right way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, even if we increase 
		domestic oil production, that is not going to be the long-term solution 
		to our energy challenge.&nbsp; I give out this statistic all the time, and 
		forgive me for repeating it again:&nbsp; America holds about 2 percent of the 
		world’s proven oil reserves.&nbsp; What that means is, is that even if we 
		drilled every drop of oil out of every single one of the reserves that 
		we possess -- offshore and onshore -- it still wouldn’t be enough to 
		meet our long-term needs.&nbsp; We consume about 25 percent of the world’s 
		oil.&nbsp; We only have 2 percent of the reserves.&nbsp; Even if we doubled U.S. 
		oil production, we’re still really short.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the only way for 
		America’s energy supply to be truly secure is by permanently reducing 
		our dependence on oil.&nbsp; We’re going to have to find ways to boost our 
		efficiency so we use less oil.&nbsp; We’ve got to discover and produce 
		cleaner, renewable sources of energy that also produce less carbon 
		pollution, which is threatening our climate.&nbsp; And we’ve got to do it 
		quickly.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, in terms of new sources 
		of energy, we have a few different options.&nbsp; The first is natural gas.&nbsp; 
		Recent innovations have given us the opportunity to tap large reserves 
		–- perhaps a century’s worth of reserves, a hundred years worth of 
		reserves -– in the shale under our feet.&nbsp; But just as is true in terms 
		of us extracting oil from the ground, we’ve got to make sure that we’re 
		extracting natural gas safely, without polluting our water supply.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why I’ve asked 
		Secretary Chu, my Energy Secretary, to work with other agencies, the 
		natural gas industry, states, and environmental experts to improve the 
		safety of this process.&nbsp; And Chu is the right guy to do this.&nbsp; He’s got 
		a Nobel Prize in physics. He actually deserved his Nobel Prize.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamasecchu.jpg" width="291" height="173">
		</font>
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">And 
		this is the kind of thing that he likes to do for fun on the weekend.&nbsp; 
		He goes into his garage and he tinkers around and figures out how to 
		extract natural gas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’m going to embarrass him 
		further.&nbsp;Last year, when we were trying to fill -- figure out how to 
		close the cap, I sent Chu down to sit in the BP offices, and he 
		essentially designed the cap that ultimately worked, and he drew up the 
		specs for it and had BP build it, construct it.&nbsp; So this is somebody who 
		knows what he’s doing.&nbsp; So for those of you who are studying physics, it 
		may actually pay off someday.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the potential for 
		natural gas is enormous.&nbsp; And this is an area where there’s actually 
		been some broad bipartisan agreement.&nbsp; Last year, more than 150 members 
		of Congress from both sides of the aisle produced legislation providing 
		incentives to use clean-burning natural gas in our vehicles instead of 
		oil. And that's a big deal.&nbsp; Getting 150 members of Congress to agree on 
		anything is a big deal.&nbsp; And they were even joined by T. Boone Pickens, 
		a businessman who made his fortune on oil, but who is out there making 
		the simple point that we can’t simply drill our way out of our energy 
		problems.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I ask members of Congress 
		and all the interested parties involved to keep at it, pass a bill that 
		helps us achieve the goal of extracting natural gas in a safe, 
		environmentally sound way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, another substitute for 
		oil that holds tremendous promise is renewable biofuels -- not just 
		ethanol, but biofuels made from things like switchgrass and wood chips 
		and biomass.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If anybody doubts the 
		potential of these fuels, consider Brazil.&nbsp; As I said, I was just there 
		last week.&nbsp; Half of Brazil’s vehicles can run on biofuels -- half of 
		their fleet of automobiles can run on biofuels instead of petroleum.&nbsp; 
		Just last week, our Air Force -- our own Air Force -- used an advanced 
		biofuel blend to fly a Raptor 22 -- an F-22 Raptor faster than the speed 
		of sound.&nbsp; Think about that.&nbsp; I mean, if an F-22 Raptor can fly at the 
		speed of -- faster than the speed of sound on biomass, then I know the 
		old beater that you’ve got, that you’re driving around in -- can 
		probably do so, too.&nbsp; There’s no reason why we can’t have our cars do 
		the same.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact, the Air Force is 
		aiming to get half of its domestic jet fuel from alternative sources by 
		2016.&nbsp; And I’m directing the Navy and the Department of Energy and 
		Agriculture to work with the private sector to create advanced biofuels 
		that can power not just fighter jets, but also trucks and commercial 
		airliners.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So there’s no reason we 
		shouldn’t be using these renewable fuels throughout America.&nbsp; And that’s 
		why we’re investing in things like fueling stations and research into 
		the next generation of biofuels.&nbsp; One of the biggest problems we have 
		with alternative energy is not just producing the energy, but also 
		distributing it.&nbsp; We’ve got gas stations all around the country, so 
		whenever you need gas you know you can fill up -- it doesn’t matter 
		where you are.&nbsp; Well, we’ve got to have that same kind of distribution 
		network when it comes to our renewable energy sources so that when you 
		are converting to a different kind of car that runs on a different kind 
		of energy, you’re going to be able to have that same convenience.&nbsp; 
		Otherwise, the market won’t work; it won’t grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over the next two years, 
		we’ll help entrepreneurs break ground for four next-generation 
		biorefineries -- each with a capacity of more than 20 million gallons 
		per year.&nbsp; And going forward, we should look for ways to reform biofuels 
		incentives to make sure that they’re meeting today’s challenges and that 
		they’re also saving taxpayers money.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So as we replace oil with 
		fuels like natural gas and biofuels, we can also reduce our dependence 
		by making cars and trucks that use less oil in the first place.&nbsp; Seventy 
		percent of our petroleum consumption goes to transportation -- 70 
		percent.&nbsp; And by the way, so does the second biggest chunk of most 
		families’ budgets goes into transportation.&nbsp; And that’s why one of the 
		best ways to make our economy less dependent on oil and save folks more 
		money is to make our transportation sector more efficient.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we went through 30 
		years where we didn’t raise fuel efficiency standards on cars.&nbsp; And part 
		of what happened in the U.S. auto industry was because oil appeared 
		relatively cheap, the U.S. auto industry decided we’re just going to 
		make our money on SUVs, and we’re not going to worry about fuel 
		efficiency.&nbsp; Thirty years of lost time when it comes to technology that 
		could improve the efficiency of cars.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So last year, we established 
		a groundbreaking national fuel efficiency standard for cars and trucks.&nbsp; 
		We did this last year without legislation.&nbsp; We just got all the parties 
		together and we got them to agree -- automakers, autoworkers, 
		environmental groups, industry.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So that means our cars 
		will be getting better gas mileage, saving 1.8 billion barrels of oil 
		over the life of the program -- 1.8 billion.&nbsp; Our consumers will save 
		money from fewer trips to the pump -- $3,000 on average over time you 
		will save because of these higher fuel efficiency standards.&nbsp; And our 
		automakers will build more innovative products.&nbsp; Right now, there are 
		even cars rolling off the assembly lines in Detroit with combustion 
		engines -- I’m not talking about hybrids -- combustion engines that get 
		more than 50 miles per gallon.&nbsp; So we know how to do it.&nbsp; We know how to 
		make our cars more efficient.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But going forward, we’re 
		going to continue to work with the automakers, with the autoworkers, 
		with states, to ensure the high-quality, fuel-efficient cars and trucks 
		of tomorrow are built right here in the United States of America.&nbsp; 
		That’s going to be a top priority for us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This summer, we’re going to 
		propose the first-ever fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks.&nbsp; 
		And this fall, we’ll announce the next round of fuel standards for cars 
		that builds on what we’ve already done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And by the way, the federal 
		government is going to need to lead by example.&nbsp; The fleet of cars and 
		trucks we use in the federal government is one of the largest in the 
		country.&nbsp; We’ve got a lot of cars.&nbsp; And that’s why we’ve already doubled 
		the number of alternative vehicles in the federal fleet.&nbsp; And that’s why 
		today I am directing agencies to purchase 100 percent alternative fuel, 
		hybrid, or electric vehicles by 2015.&nbsp; All of them should be alternative 
		fuel.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Going forward, we’ll partner 
		with private companies that want to upgrade their large fleets.&nbsp; And 
		this means, by the way, that you students, as consumers or future 
		consumers of cars, you’ve got to make sure that you are boosting demand 
		for alternative vehicles.&nbsp; You’re going to have a responsibility as 
		well, because if alternative-fuel vehicles are manufactured but you guys 
		aren’t buying them, then folks will keep on making cars that don’t have 
		the same fuel efficiency.&nbsp; So you’ve got power in this process, and the 
		decisions you make individually in your lives will say something about 
		how serious we are when it comes to energy independence.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ve also made historic 
		investments in high-speed rail and mass transit, because part of making 
		our transportation sector cleaner and more efficient involves offering 
		all Americans, whether they are urban, suburban, or rural, the choice to 
		be mobile without having to get in a car and pay for gas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Still, there are few 
		breakthroughs as promising for increasing fuel efficiency and reducing 
		our dependence on oil as electric vehicles.&nbsp; Soon after I took office, I 
		set a goal of having one million electric vehicles on our roads by 
		2015.&nbsp; We’ve created incentives for American companies to develop these 
		vehicles, and for Americans who want them to buy them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So new manufacturing plants 
		are opening over the next few years.&nbsp; And a modest $2 billion investment 
		in competitive grants for companies to develop the next generation of 
		batteries for these cars has jumpstarted a big new American industry.&nbsp; 
		Pretty soon, America will be home to 40 percent of global manufacturing 
		capacity for these advanced batteries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And for those of you who are 
		wondering what that means, the thing that’s been holding back electric 
		vehicles is the battery that stores that electricity, that energy.&nbsp; And 
		the more efficient, the more lightweight we can make those batteries, 
		the easier it is to manufacture those cars at a competitive price.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And if we can have that 
		industry here in the United States of America, that means jobs.&nbsp; If 
		those batteries are made here, the cars are made here.&nbsp; Those cars are 
		made here, we’re putting Americans back to work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, to make sure we stay on 
		this goal we’re going to need to do more -- by offering more powerful 
		incentives to consumers, and by rewarding the communities that pave the 
		way for the adoption of these vehicles.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, one other thing about 
		electric cars -- and you don't need to talk to Chu about this -- it 
		turns out electric cars run on electricity.&nbsp; And so even if we reduce 
		our oil dependency, and we’re producing all these great electric cars, 
		we’re going to have to have a plan to change the way we generate 
		electricity in America so that it’s cleaner and safer and healthier.&nbsp; We 
		know that ushering in a clean energy economy has the potential of 
		creating untold numbers of new jobs and new businesses right here in the 
		United States.&nbsp; But we’re going to have to think about how do we produce 
		electricity more efficiently.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, in addition to 
		producing it, we actually also have to think about making sure we’re not 
		wasting energy.&nbsp; I don't know how we’re doing on the Georgetown campus, 
		Mr. President, but every institution and every household has to start 
		thinking about how are we reducing the amount of energy that we’re using 
		and doing it in more efficient ways.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamageorgetownenerty.jpg" width="232" height="158">&nbsp;
		</font>
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, our homes and 
		businesses consume 40 percent of the energy that we use, and it costs us 
		billions of dollars in energy bills.&nbsp; Manufacturers that require large 
		amounts of energy to make their products, they're challenged by rising 
		energy costs.&nbsp; And so you can’t separate the issue of oil dependence 
		from the issue of how we are producing generally -- more energy 
		generally.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why we’ve 
		proposed new programs to help Americans upgrade their homes and 
		businesses and plants with new, energy-efficient building materials -- 
		new lighting, new windows, new heating and cooling systems -- 
		investments that will save consumers and business owners tens of 
		billions of dollars a year, and free up money for investment and hiring 
		and creating new jobs and hiring more workers and putting contractors to 
		work as well.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The nice thing about energy 
		efficiency is we already have the technology.&nbsp; We don’t have to create 
		something new.&nbsp; We just have to help businesses and homeowners put in 
		place the installation, the energy-efficient windows, the 
		energy-efficient lighting.&nbsp; They’ll get their money back.&nbsp; You will save 
		money on your electricity bill that pays for those improvements that you 
		made, but a lot of people may not have the money up front, and so we’ve 
		got to give them some incentives to do that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And just like the fuels we 
		use in our cars, we’re going to have to find cleaner renewable sources 
		of electricity.&nbsp; Today, about two-fifths of our electricity come from 
		clean energy sources.&nbsp; But we can do better than that.&nbsp; I think that 
		with the right incentives in place, we can double our use of clean 
		energy. And that’s why, in my State of the Union address back in 
		January, I called for a new Clean Energy Standard for America:&nbsp; By 2035, 
		80 percent of our electricity needs to come from a wide range of clean 
		energy sources -- renewables like wind and solar, efficient natural 
		gas.&nbsp; And, yes, we’re going to have to examine how do we make clean coal 
		and nuclear power work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, in light of the ongoing 
		events in Japan, I want to just take a minute to talk about nuclear 
		power.&nbsp; Right now, America gets about one-fifth of our electricity from 
		nuclear energy.&nbsp; And it’s important to recognize that nuclear energy 
		doesn’t emit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&nbsp; So those of us who are 
		concerned about climate change, we’ve got to recognize that nuclear 
		power, if it’s safe, can make a significant contribution to the climate 
		change question.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I’m determined to ensure 
		that it’s safe.&nbsp; So in light of what’s happened in Japan, I’ve requested 
		a comprehensive safety review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to 
		make sure that all of our existing nuclear energy facilities are safe.&nbsp; 
		And we’re going incorporate those conclusions and lessons from Japan in 
		design and the building of the next generation of plants.&nbsp; But we can’t 
		simply take it off the table.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My administration is leading 
		global discussions towards a new international framework in which all 
		countries who are operating nuclear plants are making sure that they’re 
		not spreading dangerous nuclear materials and technology.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But more broadly, a clean 
		energy standard can expand the scope of clean energy investments because 
		what it does is it gives cutting-edge companies the certainty that they 
		need to invest.&nbsp; Essentially what it does is it says to companies, you 
		know what, you will have a customer if you’re producing clean energy.&nbsp; 
		Utilities, they need to buy a certain amount of clean energy in their 
		overall portfolio, and that means that innovators are willing to make 
		those big capital investments.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we’ve got to start now 
		because -- think about this -- in the 1980s, America was home to more 
		than 80 percent of the world’s wind capacity, 90 percent of the world’s 
		solar capacity. We were the leaders in wind.&nbsp; We were the leaders in 
		solar.&nbsp; We owned the clean energy economy in the ‘80s.&nbsp; Guess what.&nbsp; 
		Today, China has the most wind capacity.&nbsp; Germany has the most solar 
		capacity.&nbsp; Both invest more in clean energy than we do, even though we 
		are a larger economy and a substantially larger user of energy.&nbsp; We’ve 
		fallen behind on what is going to be the key to our future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Other countries are now 
		exporting technology we pioneered and they’re going after the jobs that 
		come with it because they know that the countries that lead the 21st 
		century clean energy economy will be the countries that lead the 21st 
		century global economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want America to be that 
		nation.&nbsp; I want America to win the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So a clean energy standard 
		will help drive private investment in innovation.&nbsp; But I want to make 
		this point:&nbsp; Government funding will still be critical.&nbsp; Over the past 
		two years, the historic investments my administration has made in clean 
		and renewable energy research and technology have helped private sector 
		companies grow and hire hundreds of thousands of new workers.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ve visited gleaming new 
		solar arrays that are among the largest in the world.&nbsp; I've tested an 
		electric vehicle fresh off the assembly line.&nbsp; I mean, I didn’t really 
		test it -- I was able to drive like five feet before Secret Service said 
		to stop.&nbsp; I’ve toured factories that used to be shuttered, where they’re 
		now building advanced wind blades that are as long as 747s, and they’re 
		building the towers that support them.&nbsp; And I’ve seen the scientists 
		that are searching for the next big breakthrough in energy.&nbsp; None of 
		this would have happened without government support.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I understand we’ve got a 
		tight fiscal situation, so it’s fair to ask how do we pay for 
		government’s investment in energy. And as we debate our national 
		priorities and our budget in Congress, we’re going to have to make some 
		tough choices.&nbsp; We’re going to have to cut what we don’t need to invest 
		in what we do need.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, some folks 
		want to cut critical investments in clean energy.&nbsp; They want to cut our 
		research and development into new technologies.&nbsp; They’re shortchanging 
		the resources necessary even to promptly issue new permits for offshore 
		drilling.&nbsp; These cuts would eliminate thousands of private sector jobs; 
		it would terminate scientists and engineers; it would end fellowships 
		for researchers, some who may be here at Georgetown, graduate students 
		and other talent that we desperately need to get into this area in the 
		21st century.&nbsp; That doesn’t make sense.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re already paying a price 
		for our inaction.&nbsp; Every time we fill up at the pump, every time we lose 
		a job or a business to countries that are investing more than we do in 
		clean energy, when it comes to our air, our water, and the climate 
		change that threatens the planet that you will inherit -- we’re already 
		paying a price.&nbsp; These are costs that we are already bearing.&nbsp; And if we 
		do nothing, the price will only go up.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So at moments like these, 
		sacrificing these investments in research and development, in supporting 
		clean energy technologies, that would weaken our energy economy and make 
		us more dependent on oil.&nbsp; That’s not a game plan to win the future. 
		That’s a vision to keep us mired in the past.&nbsp; I will not accept that 
		outcome for the United States of America.&nbsp; We are not going to do that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me close by speaking 
		directly to the students here -- the next generation who are going to be 
		writing the next great chapter in the American story.&nbsp; The issue of 
		energy independence is one that America has been talking about since 
		before your parents were your age, since before you were born.&nbsp; And you 
		also happen to go to a school [in a town] that for a long time has 
		suffered from a chronic unwillingness to come together and make tough 
		choices.&nbsp; And so I forgive you for thinking that maybe there isn’t much 
		we can do to rise to this challenge.&nbsp; Maybe some of you are feeling kind 
		of cynical or skeptical about whether we’re actually going to solve this 
		problem.&nbsp; But everything I have seen and experienced with your 
		generation convinces me otherwise.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think that precisely 
		because you are coming of age at a time of such rapid and sometimes 
		unsettling change, born into a world with fewer walls, educated in an 
		era of constant information, tempered by war and economic turmoil -- 
		because that’s the world in which you’re coming of age, I think you 
		believe as deeply as any of our previous generations that America can 
		change and it can change for the better.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We need that.&nbsp; We need you 
		to dream big.&nbsp; We need you to summon that same spirit of unbridled 
		optimism and that bold willingness to tackle tough challenges and see 
		those challenges through that led previous generations to rise to 
		greatness -- to save a democracy, to touch the moon, to connect the 
		world with our own science and our own imagination.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s what America is 
		capable of.&nbsp; That's what you have to push America to do, and it will be 
		you that pushes it.&nbsp; That history of ours, of meeting challenges -- 
		that's your birthright. You understand that there’s no problem out there 
		that is not within our power to solve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t want to leave this 
		challenge for future Presidents. I don’t want to leave it for my 
		children.&nbsp; I don’t want to leave it for your children.&nbsp; So, yes, solving 
		it will take time and it will take effort.&nbsp; It will require our 
		brightest scientists, our most creative companies.&nbsp; It will require all 
		of us -- Democrats, Republicans, and everybody in between -- to do our 
		part.&nbsp; But with confidence in America and in ourselves and in one 
		another, I know this is a challenge that we will solve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, 
		everybody.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
