transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Selamat pagi. [Good 
		morning.] It 
		is wonderful to be here at the University of Indonesia.&nbsp; To the faculty 
		and the staff and the students, and to Dr. Gumilar Rusliwa Somantri, 
		thank you so much for your hospitality.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Assalamualaikum dan salam 
		sejahtera.&nbsp;[Peace be upon you and may God be with you.] Thank you for this wonderful welcome.&nbsp; Thank you to the 
		people of Jakarta and thank you to the people of Indonesia.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pulang kampung nih. [Back 
		to/in my hometown].&nbsp; 
		I am so glad that I made it back to Indonesia and that 
		Michelle was able to join me.&nbsp; We had a couple of false starts this 
		year, but I was determined to visit a country that’s meant so much to 
		me.&nbsp; And unfortunately, this visit is too short, but I look forward to 
		coming back a year from now when Indonesia hosts the East Asia Summit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Before I go any further, I 
		want to say that our thoughts and prayers are with all of those 
		Indonesians who are affected by the recent tsunami and the volcanic 
		eruptions -- particularly those who’ve lost loved ones, and those who’ve 
		been displaced.&nbsp; And I want you all to know that as always, the United 
		States stands with Indonesia in responding to natural disasters, and we 
		are pleased to be able to help as needed.&nbsp; As neighbors help neighbors 
		and families take in the displaced, I know that the strength and the 
		resilience of the Indonesian people will pull you through once more.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me begin with a simple 
		statement:&nbsp; Indonesia bagian dari didi saya.&nbsp; I first came 
		to this country when my mother married an Indonesian named Lolo Soetoro.&nbsp; 
		And as a young boy I was -- as a young boy I was coming to a different 
		world.&nbsp; But the people of Indonesia quickly made me feel at home.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Jakarta -- now, Jakarta looked very different in those days.&nbsp; The city 
		was filled with buildings that were no more than a few stories tall.&nbsp; 
		This was back in 1967, ‘68 -- most of you weren’t born yet.&nbsp; 
		The Hotel Indonesia was one of the few high rises, and 
		there was just one big department store called Sarinah.&nbsp; That was 
		it. Betchaks and bemos, that’s how you got around.&nbsp; They 
		outnumbered automobiles in those days.&nbsp; And you didn’t have all the big 
		highways that you have today.&nbsp; Most of them gave way to unpaved roads 
		and the kampongs.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So we moved to Menteng Dalam, where -- hey, some folks 
		from Menteng Dalam right here.&nbsp; And we lived in a small 
		house.&nbsp; We had a mango tree out front.&nbsp; And I learned to love Indonesia 
		while flying kites and running along the paddy fields and catching 
		dragonflies, buying satay and baso from the street vendors.&nbsp;I still remember the call of the vendors.&nbsp; Satay!&nbsp; 
		I remember that.&nbsp; Baso!&nbsp; But most of all, I 
		remember the people -- the old men and women who welcomed us with 
		smiles; the children who made a foreign child feel like a neighbor and a 
		friend; and the teachers who helped me learn about this country.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Because Indonesia is made up of thousands of islands, and hundreds of 
		languages, and people from scores of regions and ethnic groups, my time 
		here helped me appreciate the common humanity of all people.&nbsp; And while 
		my stepfather, like most Indonesians, was raised a Muslim, he firmly 
		believed that all religions were worthy of respect.&nbsp; And in this way -- 
		in this way he reflected the spirit of religious tolerance that is 
		enshrined in Indonesia’s Constitution, and that remains one of this 
		country’s defining and inspiring characteristics.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Now, I stayed here for four years -- a time that helped shape my 
		childhood; a time that saw the birth of my wonderful sister, Maya; a 
		time that made such an impression on my mother that she kept returning 
		to Indonesia over the next 20 years to live and to work and to travel -- 
		and to pursue her passion of promoting opportunity in Indonesia’s 
		villages, especially opportunity for women and for girls.&nbsp; And I was so 
		honored -- I was so honored when President Yudhoyono last 
		night at the state dinner presented an award on behalf of my mother, 
		recognizing the work that she did.&nbsp; And she would have been so proud, 
		because my mother held Indonesia and its people very close to her heart 
		for her entire life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So much has changed in the 
		four decades since I boarded a plane to move back to Hawaii.&nbsp; If you 
		asked me -- or any of my schoolmates who knew me back then -- I don’t 
		think any of us could have anticipated that one day I would come back to 
		Jakarta as the President of the United States.&nbsp; And few 
		could have anticipated the remarkable story of Indonesia over these last 
		four decades.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		The Jakarta that I once knew has grown into a teeming city of nearly 10 
		million, with skyscrapers that dwarf the Hotel Indonesia, and thriving 
		centers of culture and of commerce.&nbsp; While my Indonesian friends and I 
		used to run in fields with water buffalo and goats -- a 
		new generation of Indonesians is among the most wired in the world -- 
		connected through cell phones and social networks. And while Indonesia 
		as a young nation focused inward, a growing Indonesia now plays a key 
		role in the Asia Pacific and in the global economy.&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Now, this change also extends to politics.&nbsp; When my stepfather was 
		a boy, he watched his own father and older brother leave home to fight 
		and die in the struggle for Indonesian independence.&nbsp; And I’m happy 
		to be here on Heroes Day to honor the memory of so many Indonesians who 
		have sacrificed on behalf of this great country.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		When I moved to Jakarta, it was 1967, and it was a time that had 
		followed great suffering and conflict in parts of this country.&nbsp; And 
		even though my stepfather had served in the Army, the violence and 
		killing during that time of political upheaval was largely unknown to me 
		because it was unspoken by my Indonesian family and friends.&nbsp; In my 
		household, like so many others across Indonesia, the memories of that 
		time were an invisible presence.&nbsp; Indonesians had their independence, 
		but oftentimes they were afraid to speak their minds about issues.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		In the years since then, Indonesia has charted its own course through an 
		extraordinary democratic transformation -- from the rule of an iron fist 
		to the rule of the people.&nbsp; In recent years, the world has watched with 
		hope and admiration as Indonesians embraced the peaceful transfer of 
		power and the direct election of leaders.&nbsp; And just as your democracy is 
		symbolized by your elected President and legislature, your democracy is 
		sustained and fortified by its checks and balances:&nbsp; a dynamic civil 
		society; political parties and unions; a vibrant media and engaged 
		citizens who have ensured that -- in Indonesia -- there will be no 
		turning back from democracy.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		But even as this land of my youth has changed in so many ways, those 
		things that I learned to love about Indonesia -- that spirit of 
		tolerance that is written into your Constitution; symbolized in mosques 
		and churches and temples standing alongside each other; that spirit 
		that’s embodied in your people -- that still lives on.&nbsp; Bhinneka Tunggal Ika -- unity in diversity.&nbsp;This is the 
		foundation of Indonesia’s example to the world, and this is why 
		Indonesia will play such an important part in the 21st century.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So today, I return to Indonesia as a friend, but also as a President who 
		seeks a deep and enduring partnership between our two countries.&nbsp; 
		Because as vast and diverse countries; as neighbors on 
		either side of the Pacific; and above all as democracies -- the United 
		States and Indonesia are bound together by shared interests and shared 
		values.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Yesterday, President Yudhoyono and I announced a new Comprehensive 
		Partnership between the United States and Indonesia.&nbsp; We are increasing 
		ties between our governments in many different areas, and -- just as 
		importantly -- we are increasing ties among our people.&nbsp; This is a 
		partnership of equals, grounded in mutual interests and mutual respect.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So with the rest of my time today, I’d like to talk about why the story 
		I just told -- the story of Indonesia since the days when I lived here 
		-- is so important to the United States and to the world.&nbsp; I will focus 
		on three areas that are closely related, and fundamental to human 
		progress -- development, democracy and religious faith.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		First, the friendship between the United States and Indonesia can 
		advance our mutual interest in development.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		When I moved to Indonesia, it would have been hard to imagine a future 
		in which the prosperity of families in Chicago and Jakarta would be 
		connected.&nbsp; But our economies are now global, and Indonesians have 
		experienced both the promise and the perils of globalization:&nbsp; from the 
		shock of the Asian financial crisis in the ‘90s, to the millions lifted 
		out of poverty because of increased trade and commerce.&nbsp; What that means 
		-- and what we learned in the recent economic crisis -- is that we have 
		a stake in each other’s success.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		America has a stake in Indonesia growing and developing, with prosperity 
		that is broadly shared among the Indonesian people -- because a rising 
		middle class here in Indonesia means new markets for our goods, just as 
		America is a market for goods coming from Indonesia.&nbsp; So we are 
		investing more in Indonesia, and our exports have grown by nearly 50 
		percent, and we are opening doors for Americans and Indonesians to do 
		business with one another.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America has a stake in an 
		Indonesia that plays its rightful role in shaping the global economy.&nbsp; 
		Gone are the days when seven or eight countries would come together to 
		determine the direction of global markets.&nbsp; That’s why the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20"><font color="#0000FF">G20</font></a> is 
		now the center of international economic cooperation, so that emerging 
		economies like Indonesia have a greater voice and also bear greater 
		responsibility for guiding the global economy.&nbsp; And through its 
		leadership of the G20’s anti-corruption group, Indonesia should lead on 
		the world stage and by example in embracing transparency and 
		accountability.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		America has a stake in an Indonesia that pursues sustainable 
		development, because the way we grow will determine the quality of our 
		lives and the health of our planet.&nbsp; And that’s why we’re 
		developing clean energy technologies that can power industry and 
		preserve Indonesia’s precious natural resources -- and America welcomes 
		your country’s strong leadership in the global effort to combat climate 
		change.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Above all, America has a stake in the success of the Indonesian people.&nbsp; 
		Underneath the headlines of the day, we must build bridges between our 
		people, because our future security and prosperity is shared.&nbsp; And that 
		is exactly what we’re doing -- by increasing collaboration among our 
		scientists and researchers, and by working together to foster 
		entrepreneurship.&nbsp; And I’m especially pleased that we have committed to 
		double the number of American and Indonesian students studying in our 
		respective countries.&nbsp; We want more Indonesian students in 
		American schools, and we want more American students to come study in 
		this country.&nbsp; We want to forge new ties and greater 
		understanding between young people in this young century.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		These are the issues that really matter in our daily lives.&nbsp; 
		Development, after all, is not simply about growth rates and numbers on 
		a balance sheet.&nbsp; It’s about whether a child can learn the skills they 
		need to make it in a changing world.&nbsp; It’s about whether a good idea is 
		allowed to grow into a business, and not suffocated by corruption.&nbsp; It’s 
		about whether those forces that have transformed the Jakarta I once knew 
		-- technology and trade and the flow of people and goods -- can 
		translate into a better life for all Indonesians, for all human beings, 
		a life marked by dignity and opportunity.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Now, this kind of development is inseparable from the role of democracy.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		Today, we sometimes hear that democracy stands in the way of economic 
		progress.&nbsp; This is not a new argument.&nbsp; Particularly in times of change 
		and economic uncertainty, some will say that it is easier to take a 
		shortcut to development by trading away the right of human beings for 
		the power of the state.&nbsp; But that’s not what I saw on my trip to India, 
		and that is not what I see here in Indonesia.&nbsp; Your achievements 
		demonstrate that democracy and development reinforce one another.&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Like any democracy, you have known setbacks along the way.&nbsp; America is 
		no different.&nbsp; Our own Constitution spoke of the effort to forge a “<a href="../barackobamaperfectunion.htm"><font color="#0000FF">more 
		perfect union</font></a>,” and that is a journey that we’ve traveled ever since.&nbsp; 
		We’ve endured civil war and we struggled to extend equal rights to all 
		of our citizens.&nbsp; But it is precisely this effort that has allowed us to 
		become stronger and more prosperous, while also becoming a more just and 
		a more free society.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Like other countries that emerged from colonial rule in the last 
		century, Indonesia struggled and sacrificed for the right to determine 
		your destiny.&nbsp; That is what Heroes Day is all about -- an Indonesia that 
		belongs to Indonesians.&nbsp; But you also ultimately decided that freedom 
		cannot mean replacing the strong hand of a colonizer with a strongman of 
		your own.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Of course, democracy is messy.&nbsp; Not everyone likes the results of every 
		election.&nbsp; You go through your ups and downs.&nbsp; But the journey is 
		worthwhile, and it goes beyond casting a ballot.&nbsp; It takes strong 
		institutions to check the power -- the concentration of power.&nbsp; It takes 
		open markets to allow individuals to thrive.&nbsp; It takes a free press and 
		an independent justice system to root out abuses and excess, and to 
		insist on accountability.&nbsp; It takes open society and active citizens to 
		reject inequality and injustice.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		These are the forces that will propel Indonesia forward.&nbsp; And it will 
		require a refusal to tolerate the corruption that stands in the way of 
		opportunity; a commitment to transparency that gives every Indonesian a 
		stake in their government; and a belief that the freedom of Indonesians 
		-- that Indonesians have fought for is what holds this great nation 
		together.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		That is the message of the Indonesians who have advanced this democratic 
		story -- from those who fought in the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Surabaya">
		<font color="#0000FF">Battle of Surabaya</font></a> 55 years ago 
		today; to the students who marched peacefully for democracy in the 
		1990s; to leaders who have embraced the peaceful transition of power in 
		this young century.&nbsp; Because ultimately, it will be the rights of 
		citizens that will stitch together this remarkable Nusantara that 
		stretches from Sabang to Merauke, an insistence -- an 
		insistence that every child born in this country should be treated 
		equally, whether they come from Java or Aceh; from Bali or Papua.&nbsp; That all Indonesians have equal rights.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		That effort extends to the example that Indonesia is now setting 
		abroad.&nbsp; Indonesia took the initiative to establish the Bali Democracy 
		Forum, an open forum for countries to share their experiences and best 
		practices in fostering democracy.&nbsp; Indonesia has also been at the 
		forefront of pushing for more attention to human rights within 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN"><font color="#0000FF">ASEAN</font></a>.&nbsp; 
		The nations of Southeast Asia must have the right to determine their own 
		destiny, and the United States will strongly support that right.&nbsp; But 
		the people of Southeast Asia must have the right to determine their own 
		destiny as well.&nbsp; And that’s why we condemned elections in Burma 
		recently that were neither free nor fair.&nbsp; That is why we are supporting 
		your vibrant civil society in working with counterparts across this 
		region.&nbsp; Because there’s no reason why respect for human rights should 
		stop at the border of any country.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Hand in hand, that is what development and democracy are about -- the 
		notion that certain values are universal.&nbsp; Prosperity without freedom is 
		just another form of poverty.&nbsp; Because there are aspirations that human 
		beings share -- the liberty of knowing that your leader is accountable 
		to you, and that you won’t be locked up for disagreeing with them; the 
		opportunity to get an education and to be able to work with dignity; the 
		freedom to practice your faith without fear or restriction.&nbsp; Those are 
		universal values that must be observed everywhere.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, religion is the final 
		topic that I want to address today, and -- like democracy and 
		development -- it is fundamental to the Indonesian story.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Like the other Asian nations that I’m visiting on this trip, Indonesia 
		is steeped in spirituality -- a place where people worship God in many 
		different ways.&nbsp; Along with this rich diversity, it is also home to 
		the world’s largest Muslim population -- a truth I came to know as a boy 
		when I heard the call to prayer across Jakarta.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Just as individuals are not defined solely by their faith, Indonesia is 
		defined by more than its Muslim population.&nbsp; But we also know that 
		relations between the United States and Muslim communities have frayed 
		over many years.&nbsp; As President, I have made it a priority to begin to 
		repair these relations.&nbsp; As part of that effort, I went to 
		Cairo last June, and <a href="barackobamacairouniversity.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">I called for a new beginning</font></a> between the United 
		States and Muslims around the world -- one that creates a path for us to 
		move beyond our differences.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		I said then, and I will repeat now, that no single speech can eradicate 
		years of mistrust.&nbsp; But I believed then, and I believe today, that 
		we do have a choice.&nbsp; We can choose to be defined by our 
		differences, and give in to a future of suspicion and mistrust.&nbsp; Or 
		we can choose to do the hard work of forging common ground, and commit 
		ourselves to the steady pursuit of progress.&nbsp; And I can promise you 
		-- no matter what setbacks may come, the United States is committed to 
		human progress.&nbsp; That is who we are.&nbsp; That is what we’ve done.&nbsp; 
		And that is what we will do.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Now, we know well the issues that have caused tensions for many years -- 
		and these are issues that I addressed in Cairo.&nbsp; In the 17 months that 
		have passed since that speech, we have made some progress, but we have 
		much more work to do.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Innocent civilians in America, in Indonesia and across the world are 
		still targeted by violent extremism.&nbsp; I made clear that America is not, 
		and never will be, at war with Islam.&nbsp; Instead, all of us must work 
		together to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates, who have no claim to be 
		leaders of any religion -- certainly not a great, world religion like 
		Islam.&nbsp; But those who want to build must not cede ground to terrorists 
		who seek to destroy.&nbsp; And this is not a task for America alone.&nbsp; Indeed, 
		here in Indonesia, you’ve made progress in rooting out extremists and 
		combating such violence.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		In Afghanistan, we continue to work with a coalition of nations to build 
		the capacity of the Afghan government to secure its future.&nbsp; Our 
		shared interest is in building peace in a war-torn land -- a peace that 
		provides no safe haven for violent extremists, and that provide hope for 
		the Afghan people.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Meanwhile, we’ve made progress on one of our core commitments -- our 
		effort to end the war in Iraq.&nbsp; Nearly 100,000 American troops have now 
		left Iraq under my presidency.&nbsp; Iraqis have taken full 
		responsibility for their security.&nbsp; And we will continue to support Iraq 
		as it forms an inclusive government, and we will bring all of our troops 
		home.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		In the Middle East, we have faced false starts and setbacks, but we’ve 
		been persistent in our pursuit of peace.&nbsp; Israelis and Palestinians 
		restarted direct talks, but enormous obstacles remain.&nbsp; There 
		should be no illusion that peace and security will come easy.&nbsp; But 
		let there be no doubt:&nbsp; America will spare no effort in working for 
		the outcome that is just, and that is in the interests of all the 
		parties involved -- <a href="../gwbushtwostatesolution.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">two states, Israel and Palestine</font></a>, living side by 
		side in peace and security.&nbsp; That is our goal.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		The stakes are high in resolving all of these issues.&nbsp; For our world has 
		grown smaller, and while those forces that connect us have unleashed 
		opportunity and great wealth, they also empower those who seek to derail 
		progress.&nbsp; One bomb in a marketplace can obliterate the bustle of daily 
		commerce.&nbsp; One whispered rumor can obscure the truth and set off 
		violence between communities that once lived together in peace.&nbsp; In an 
		age of rapid change and colliding cultures, what we share as human 
		beings can sometimes be lost.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		But I believe that the history of both America and Indonesia should give 
		us hope.&nbsp; It is a story written into our national mottos.&nbsp; In the United 
		States, our motto is E pluribus unum -- out of many, one.&nbsp; Bhinneka 
		Tunggal Ika -- unity in diversity.&nbsp; We are two nations, 
		which have traveled different paths.&nbsp; Yet our nations show that hundreds 
		of millions who hold different beliefs can be united in freedom under 
		one flag.&nbsp; And we are now building on that shared humanity -- through 
		young people who will study in each other’s schools; through the 
		entrepreneurs forging ties that can lead to greater prosperity; and 
		through our embrace of fundamental democratic values and human 
		aspirations.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		Before I came here, I visited 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istiqlal_Mosque">
		<font color="#0000FF">Istiqlal mosque</font></a> -- a place of worship that 
		was still under construction when I lived in Jakarta.&nbsp; And I admired its 
		soaring minaret and its imposing dome and welcoming space.&nbsp; But its name 
		and history also speak to what makes Indonesia great.&nbsp; Istiqlal 
		means independence, and its construction was in part a testament to the 
		nation’s struggle for freedom.&nbsp; Moreover, this house of worship for 
		many thousands of Muslims was designed by a Christian architect.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Such is Indonesia’s spirit.&nbsp; Such is the message of Indonesia’s 
		inclusive philosophy, 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancasila_(politics)">
		<font color="#0000FF">Pancasila</font></a>.&nbsp; Across an archipelago 
		that contains some of God’s most beautiful creations, islands rising 
		above an ocean named for peace, people choose to worship God as they 
		please.&nbsp; Islam flourishes, but so do other faiths.&nbsp; Development is 
		strengthened by an emerging democracy.&nbsp; Ancient traditions endure, even 
		as a rising power is on the move.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		That is not to say that Indonesia is without imperfections.&nbsp; No country 
		is.&nbsp; But here we can find the ability to bridge divides of race and 
		region and religion -- by the ability to see yourself in other people.&nbsp; 
		As a child of a different race who came here from a distant country, I 
		found this spirit in the greeting that I received upon moving here:&nbsp; 
		Selamat Datang.&nbsp; As a Christian visiting a mosque on this visit, I found 
		it in the words of a leader who was asked about my visit and said, 
		“Muslims are also allowed in churches.&nbsp; We are all God’s followers.”<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		That spark of the divine lives within each of us.&nbsp; We cannot give in to 
		doubt or cynicism or despair.&nbsp; The stories of Indonesia and America 
		should make us optimistic, because it tells us that history is on the 
		side of human progress; that unity is more powerful than division; and 
		that the people of this world can live together in peace.&nbsp; May our two 
		nations, working together, with faith and determination, share these 
		truths with all mankind.</font></p>

		mengucapkan kepada seluruh rakyat Indonesia:&nbsp;Terima kasih atas.&nbsp; Terima

		to all Indonesia: Thank you for your assistance. Thank you. Peace be 
		upon you.]</font></p>
