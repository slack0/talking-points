transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, President Spar, 
		trustees, President Bollinger.&nbsp; Hello, Class of 2012!&nbsp; Congratulations 
		on reaching this day.&nbsp; Thank you for the honor of being able to be a 
		part of it.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are so many people who 
		are proud of you -- your parents, family, faculty, friends -- all who 
		share in this achievement.&nbsp; So please give them a big round of 
		applause.&nbsp; To all the moms who are here today, you could not ask for a 
		better Mother’s Day gift than to see all of these folks graduate.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have to say, though, 
		whenever I come to these things, I start thinking about Malia and Sasha 
		graduating, and I start tearing up and -- it's terrible.&nbsp; I don't know 
		how you guys are holding it together.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will begin by telling a 
		hard truth:&nbsp; I’m a Columbia college graduate.&nbsp; I know there can be a 
		little bit of a sibling rivalry here.&nbsp; But I’m honored nevertheless to 
		be your commencement speaker today -- although I’ve got to say, you set 
		a pretty high bar given the past three years.&nbsp;Hillary Clinton -- Meryl 
		Streep -- Sheryl Sandberg -- these are not easy acts to follow.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I will point out Hillary 
		is doing an extraordinary job as one of the finest Secretaries of State 
		America has ever had.&nbsp; We gave Meryl the Presidential Medal 
		of Arts and Humanities.&nbsp; Sheryl is not just a good friend; 
		she’s also one of our economic advisers.&nbsp; So it’s like the old saying 
		goes -- keep your friends close, and your Barnard commencement speakers 
		even closer.&nbsp;There's wisdom in that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the year I graduated -- 
		this area looks familiar -- the year I graduated was 1983, 
		the first year women were admitted to Columbia.&nbsp; Sally Ride 
		was the first American woman in space.&nbsp; Music was all about Michael and 
		the Moonwalk.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Do it!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; No 
		Moonwalking.&nbsp; No Moonwalking today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We had the Walkman, not 
		iPods.&nbsp; Some of the streets around here were not quite so inviting.&nbsp; 
		Times Square was not a family destination.&nbsp;So 
		I know this is all ancient history.&nbsp; Nothing worse than commencement 
		speakers droning on about bygone days.&nbsp; But for all the 
		differences, the Class of 1983 actually had a lot in common with all of 
		you.&nbsp; For we, too, were heading out into a world at a moment when our 
		country was still recovering from a particularly severe economic 
		recession.&nbsp; It was a time of change.&nbsp; It was a time of uncertainty.&nbsp; It 
		was a time of passionate political debates.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can relate to this 
		because just as you were starting out finding your way around this 
		campus, an economic crisis struck that would claim more than 5 million 
		jobs before the end of your freshman year.&nbsp; Since then, some of you have 
		probably seen parents put off retirement, friends struggle to find 
		work.&nbsp; And you may be looking toward the future with that same sense of 
		concern that my generation did when we were sitting where you are now.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, as young women, 
		you’re also going to grapple with some unique challenges, like whether 
		you’ll be able to earn equal pay for equal work; whether you’ll be able 
		to balance the demands of your job and your family; whether you’ll be 
		able to fully control decisions about your own health.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And while opportunities for 
		women have grown exponentially over the last 30 years, as young people, 
		in many ways you have it even tougher than we did.&nbsp; This recession has 
		been more brutal, the job losses steeper.&nbsp; Politics seems nastier.&nbsp; 
		Congress more gridlocked than ever.&nbsp; Some folks in the financial world 
		have not exactly been model corporate citizens.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No wonder that faith in our 
		institutions has never been lower, particularly when good news doesn’t 
		get the same kind of ratings as bad news anymore.&nbsp; Every day you receive 
		a steady stream of sensationalism and scandal and stories with a message 
		that suggest change isn’t possible; that you can’t make a difference; 
		that you won’t be able to close that gap between life as it is and life 
		as you want it to be.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My job today is to tell you 
		don’t believe it.&nbsp; Because as tough as things have been, I am convinced 
		you are tougher.&nbsp; I’ve seen your passion and I’ve seen your service.&nbsp; 
		I’ve seen you engage and I’ve seen you turn out in record numbers.&nbsp; I’ve 
		heard your voices amplified by creativity and a digital fluency that 
		those of us in older generations can barely comprehend.&nbsp; I’ve seen a 
		generation eager, impatient even, to step into the rushing waters of 
		history and change its course.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that defiant, can-do 
		spirit is what runs through the veins of American history.&nbsp; It’s the 
		lifeblood of all our progress.&nbsp; And it is that spirit which we need your 
		generation to embrace and rekindle right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">See, the question is not 
		whether things will get better -- they always do.&nbsp; The question is not 
		whether we’ve got the solutions to our challenges -- we’ve had them 
		within our grasp for quite some time.&nbsp; We know, for example, that this 
		country would be better off if more Americans were able to get the kind 
		of education that you’ve received here at Barnard -- if 
		more people could get the specific skills and training that employers 
		are looking for today.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know that we’d all be 
		better off if we invest in science and technology that sparks new 
		businesses and medical breakthroughs; if we developed more clean energy 
		so we could use less foreign oil and reduce the carbon pollution that’s 
		threatening our planet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know that we’re better 
		off when there are rules that stop big banks from making bad bets with 
		other people’s money and -- when insurance companies 
		aren’t allowed to drop your coverage when you need it most or charge 
		women differently from men.&nbsp; Indeed, we know we are better 
		off when women are treated fairly and equally in every aspect of 
		American life -- whether it’s the salary you earn or the health 
		decisions you make.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know these things to be 
		true.&nbsp; We know that our challenges are eminently solvable.&nbsp; The question 
		is whether together, we can muster the will -- in our own lives, in our 
		common institutions, in our politics -- to bring about the changes we 
		need.&nbsp; And I’m convinced your generation possesses that will.&nbsp; And I 
		believe that the women of this generation -- that all of you will help 
		lead the way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I recognize that’s a 
		cheap applause line when you're giving a commencement at Barnard.&nbsp;It’s the easy thing to say.&nbsp; But it’s true.&nbsp; It is -- in 
		part, it is simple math.&nbsp; Today, women are not just half this country; 
		you’re half its workforce.&nbsp; More and more women are 
		out-earning their husbands.&nbsp; You’re more than half of our college 
		graduates, and master’s graduates, and PhDs.&nbsp; So you’ve 
		got us outnumbered.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">After decades of slow, 
		steady, extraordinary progress, you are now poised to make this the 
		century where women shape not only their own destiny but the destiny of 
		this nation and of this world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But how far your leadership 
		takes this country, how far it takes this world -- well, that will be up 
		to you.&nbsp; You’ve got to want it.&nbsp; It will not be handed to you.&nbsp; And as 
		someone who wants that future -- that better future -- for you, and for 
		Malia and Sasha, as somebody who’s had the good fortune of being the 
		husband and the father and the son of some strong, remarkable women, 
		allow me to offer just a few pieces of advice.&nbsp; That's obligatory.&nbsp; 
		Bear with me.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My first piece of advice is 
		this:&nbsp; Don’t just get involved.&nbsp; Fight for your seat at the table.&nbsp; 
		Better yet, fight for a seat at the head of the table.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s been said that the 
		most important role in our democracy is the role of citizen.&nbsp; And 
		indeed, it was 225 years ago today that the Constitutional Convention 
		opened in Philadelphia, and our founders, citizens all, began crafting 
		an extraordinary document.&nbsp; Yes, it had its flaws -- flaws that 
		this nation has strived to protect (perfect) over time.&nbsp; Questions 
		of race and gender were unresolved.&nbsp; No woman’s signature graced 
		the original document -- although we can assume that there were founding 
		mothers whispering smarter things in the ears of the founding fathers.&nbsp; I mean, that's almost certain.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What made this document 
		special was that it provided the space -- the possibility -- for those 
		who had been left out of our charter to fight their way in.&nbsp; It provided 
		people the language to appeal to principles and ideals that broadened 
		democracy’s reach.&nbsp; It allowed for protest, and movements, and the 
		dissemination of new ideas that would repeatedly, decade after decade, 
		change the world -- a constant forward movement that continues to this 
		day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our founders understood that 
		America does not stand still; we are dynamic, not static.&nbsp; We look 
		forward, not back.&nbsp; And now that new doors have been opened for you, 
		you’ve got an obligation to seize those opportunities.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You need to do this not just 
		for yourself but for those who don’t yet enjoy the choices that you’ve 
		had, the choices you will have.&nbsp; And one reason many workplaces still 
		have outdated policies is because women only account for 3 percent of 
		the CEOs at Fortune 500 companies.&nbsp; One reason we’re actually refighting 
		long-settled battles over women’s rights is because women occupy fewer 
		than one in five seats in Congress.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I’m not saying that the 
		only way to achieve success is by climbing to the top of the corporate 
		ladder or running for office -- although, let’s face it, Congress would 
		get a lot more done if you did.&nbsp; That I think 
		we’re sure about.&nbsp; But if you decide not to sit yourself at the table, 
		at the very least you’ve got to make sure you have a say in who does.&nbsp; 
		It matters.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Before women like Barbara 
		Mikulski and Olympia Snowe and others got to Congress, just to take one 
		example, much of federally-funded research on diseases focused solely on 
		their effects on men.&nbsp; It wasn’t until women like Patsy Mink and Edith 
		Green got to Congress and passed Title IX, 40 years ago this year, that 
		we declared women, too, should be allowed to compete and win on 
		America’s playing fields.&nbsp; Until a woman named Lilly 
		Ledbetter showed up at her office and had the courage to step up and 
		say, you know what, this isn’t right, women weren’t being treated fairly 
		-- we lacked some of the tools we needed to uphold the basic principle 
		of equal pay for equal work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So don’t accept somebody 
		else’s construction of the way things ought to be.&nbsp; It’s up to you to 
		right wrongs.&nbsp; It’s up to you to point out injustice.&nbsp; It’s up to you to 
		hold the system accountable and sometimes upend it entirely.&nbsp; It’s up to 
		you to stand up and to be heard, to write and to lobby, to march, to 
		organize, to vote.&nbsp; Don’t be content to just sit back and watch.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who oppose change, 
		those who benefit from an unjust status quo, have always bet on the 
		public’s cynicism or the public's complacency.&nbsp; Throughout American 
		history, though, they have lost that bet, and I believe they will this 
		time as well.&nbsp; But ultimately, Class of 2012, that will 
		depend on you.&nbsp; Don’t wait for the person next to you to be the first to 
		speak up for what’s right.&nbsp; Because maybe, just maybe, they’re waiting 
		on you.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Which brings me to my second 
		piece of advice:&nbsp; Never underestimate the power of your example.&nbsp; The 
		very fact that you are graduating, let alone that more women now 
		graduate from college than men, is only possible because earlier 
		generations of women -- your mothers, your grandmothers, your aunts -- 
		shattered the myth that you couldn’t or shouldn’t be where you are.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think of a friend of mine 
		who’s the daughter of immigrants.&nbsp; When she was in high school, her 
		guidance counselor told her, you know what, you’re just not college 
		material.&nbsp; You should think about becoming a secretary.&nbsp; Well, she was 
		stubborn, so she went to college anyway.&nbsp; She got her master’s.&nbsp; She ran 
		for local office, won.&nbsp; She ran for state office, she won.&nbsp; She ran for 
		Congress, she won.&nbsp; And lo and behold, Hilda Solis did end up becoming a 
		secretary -- she is America’s Secretary of Labor.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So think about what that 
		means to a young Latina girl when she sees a Cabinet secretary that 
		looks like her.&nbsp; Think about what it means to a young girl 
		in Iowa when she sees a presidential candidate who looks like her.&nbsp; 
		Think about what it means to a young girl walking in Harlem right down 
		the street when she sees a U.N. ambassador who looks like her.&nbsp; Do not 
		underestimate the power of your example.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This diploma opens up new 
		possibilities, so reach back, convince a young girl to earn one, too.&nbsp; 
		If you earned your degree in areas where we need more women -- like 
		computer science or engineering -- reach back and persuade 
		another student to study it, too.&nbsp; If you're going into fields where we 
		need more women, like construction or computer engineering -- reach 
		back, hire someone new.&nbsp; Be a mentor.&nbsp; Be a role model.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Until a girl can imagine 
		herself, can picture herself as a computer programmer, or a combatant 
		commander, she won’t become one.&nbsp; Until there are women who tell her, 
		ignore our pop culture obsession over beauty and fashion -- and focus instead on studying and inventing and competing and 
		leading, she’ll think those are the only things that girls are supposed 
		to care about.&nbsp; Now, Michelle will say, nothing wrong with caring about 
		it a little bit.&nbsp;You can be stylish and powerful, too.&nbsp; That's Michelle’s advice.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And never forget that the 
		most important example a young girl will ever follow is that of a 
		parent.&nbsp; Malia and Sasha are going to be outstanding women because 
		Michelle and Marian Robinson are outstanding women.&nbsp; So understand your 
		power, and use it wisely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My last piece of advice -- 
		this is simple, but perhaps most important:&nbsp; Persevere.&nbsp; Persevere.&nbsp; 
		Nothing worthwhile is easy.&nbsp; No one of achievement has avoided failure 
		-- sometimes catastrophic failures.&nbsp; But they keep at it.&nbsp; They learn 
		from mistakes.&nbsp; They don’t quit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, when I first 
		arrived on this campus, it was with little money, fewer options.&nbsp; But it 
		was here that I tried to find my place in this world.&nbsp; I knew I wanted 
		to make a difference, but it was vague how in fact I’d go about it.&nbsp; 
		But I wanted to do my part to do my part to shape a better 
		world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So even as I worked after 
		graduation in a few unfulfilling jobs here in New York -- I will not 
		list them all -- even as I went from motley apartment to 
		motley apartment, I reached out.&nbsp; I started to write letters to 
		community organizations all across the country.&nbsp; And one day, a small 
		group of churches on the South Side of Chicago answered, offering me 
		work with people in neighborhoods hit hard by steel mills that were 
		shutting down and communities where jobs were dying away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The community had been 
		plagued by gang violence, so once I arrived, one of the first things we 
		tried to do was to mobilize a meeting with community leaders to deal 
		with gangs.&nbsp; And I’d worked for weeks on this project.&nbsp; We invited the 
		police; we made phone calls; we went to churches; we passed out flyers.&nbsp; 
		The night of the meeting we arranged rows and rows of chairs in 
		anticipation of this crowd.&nbsp; And we waited, and we waited.&nbsp; And finally, 
		a group of older folks walked in to the hall and they sat down.&nbsp; And 
		this little old lady raised her hand and asked, “Is this where the bingo 
		game is?”&nbsp; It was a disaster.&nbsp; Nobody showed up.&nbsp; My first 
		big community meeting -- nobody showed up.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And later, the volunteers I 
		worked with told me, that's it; we’re quitting.&nbsp; They'd been doing this 
		for two years even before I had arrived.&nbsp; They had nothing to show for 
		it.&nbsp; And I’ll be honest, I felt pretty discouraged as well.&nbsp; I didn't 
		know what I was doing.&nbsp; I thought about quitting.&nbsp; And as we were 
		talking, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant 
		lot across the street.&nbsp; And they were just throwing rocks up at a 
		boarded building.&nbsp; They had nothing better to do&nbsp; -- late at night, just 
		throwing rocks.&nbsp; And I said to the volunteers, “Before you quit, answer 
		one question.&nbsp; What will happen to those boys if you quit?&nbsp; Who will 
		fight for them if we don’t?&nbsp; Who will give them a fair shot if we leave?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And one by one, the 
		volunteers decided not to quit.&nbsp; We went back to those neighborhoods and 
		we kept at it.&nbsp; We registered new voters, and we set up after-school 
		programs, and we fought for new jobs, and helped people live lives with 
		some measure of dignity.&nbsp; And we sustained ourselves with those small 
		victories.&nbsp; We didn’t set the world on fire.&nbsp; Some of those communities 
		are still very poor.&nbsp; There are still a lot of gangs out there.&nbsp; But I 
		believe that it was those small victories that helped me win the bigger 
		victories of my last three and a half years as President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I wish I could say that 
		this perseverance came from some innate toughness in me.&nbsp; But the truth 
		is, it was learned.&nbsp; I got it from watching the people who raised me.&nbsp; 
		More specifically, I got it from watching the women who shaped my life.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I grew up as the son of a 
		single mom who struggled to put herself through school and make ends 
		meet.&nbsp; She had marriages that fell apart; even went on food stamps at 
		one point to help us get by.&nbsp; But she didn’t quit.&nbsp; And she earned her 
		degree, and made sure that through scholarships and hard work, my sister 
		and I earned ours.&nbsp; She used to wake me up when we were living overseas 
		-- wake me up before dawn to study my English
		lessons.&nbsp; And when I’d complain, she’d just look at me and say, “This is 
		no picnic for me either, buster.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And my mom ended up 
		dedicating herself to helping women
		around the world access the money they needed to start their own 
		businesses -- she was an early pioneer in microfinance.&nbsp; And that meant, 
		though, that she was gone a lot, and she had her own struggles trying to 
		figure out balancing motherhood and a career.&nbsp; And when she was gone, my 
		grandmother stepped up to take care of me.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">She only had a high school 
		education.&nbsp; She got a job at a local bank.&nbsp; She hit the glass ceiling, 
		and watched men she once trained promoted up the ladder ahead of her.&nbsp; 
		But she didn’t quit.&nbsp; Rather than grow hard or angry each time she got 
		passed over, she kept doing her job as best as she knew how, and 
		ultimately ended up being vice president at the bank.&nbsp; She didn’t quit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And later on, I met a woman 
		who was assigned to advise me on my first summer job at a law firm.&nbsp; And 
		she gave me such good advice that I married her.&nbsp; And 
		Michelle and I gave everything we had to balance our careers and a young 
		family.&nbsp; But let’s face it, no matter how enlightened I must have 
		thought myself to be, it often fell more on her shoulders when I was 
		traveling, when I was away.&nbsp; I know that when she was with our girls, 
		she’d feel guilty that she wasn’t giving enough time to her work, and 
		when she was at her work, she’d feel guilty she wasn’t giving enough 
		time to our girls.&nbsp; And both of us wished we had some superpower that 
		would let us be in two places at once.&nbsp; But we persisted.&nbsp; We made that 
		marriage work.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the reason Michelle had 
		the strength to juggle everything, and put up with me and eventually the 
		public spotlight, was because she, too, came from a family of folks who 
		didn’t quit -- because she saw her dad get up and go to work every day 
		even though he never finished college, even though he had crippling MS.&nbsp; 
		She saw her mother, even though she never finished college, in that 
		school, that urban school, every day making sure Michelle and her 
		brother were getting the education they deserved.&nbsp; Michelle saw how her 
		parents never quit.&nbsp; They never indulged in self-pity, no matter how 
		stacked the odds were against them.&nbsp; They didn't quit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those are the folks who 
		inspire me.&nbsp; People ask me sometimes, who inspires you, Mr. President?&nbsp; 
		Those quiet heroes all across this country -- some of your parents and 
		grandparents who are sitting here -- no fanfare, no articles written 
		about them, they just persevere.&nbsp; They just do their jobs.&nbsp; They meet 
		their responsibilities.&nbsp; They don't quit.&nbsp; I'm only here because of 
		them.&nbsp; They may not have set out to change the world, but in small, 
		important ways, they did.&nbsp; They certainly changed mine.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So whether it’s starting a 
		business, or running for office, or raising a amazing family, remember 
		that making your mark on the world is hard.&nbsp; It takes patience.&nbsp; It 
		takes commitment.&nbsp; It comes with plenty of setbacks and it comes with 
		plenty of failures.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But whenever you feel that 
		creeping cynicism, whenever you hear those voices say you can’t make a 
		difference, whenever somebody tells you to set your sights lower -- the 
		trajectory of this country should give you hope.&nbsp; Previous generations 
		should give you hope.&nbsp; What young generations have done before should 
		give you hope.&nbsp; Young folks who marched and mobilized and stood up and 
		sat in, from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, didn’t just do it for 
		themselves; they did it for other people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s how we achieved 
		women’s rights.&nbsp; That's how we achieved voting rights.&nbsp; That's how we 
		achieved workers’ rights.&nbsp; That's how we achieved gay rights.&nbsp; That’s how we’ve made this Union more perfect.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And if you’re willing to do 
		your part now, if you're willing to reach up and close that gap between 
		what America is and what America should be, I want you to know that I 
		will be right there with you.&nbsp; If you are ready to fight for that 
		brilliant, radically simple idea of America that no matter who you are 
		or what you look like, no matter who you love or what God you worship, 
		you can still pursue your own happiness, I will join you every step of 
		the way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now more than ever -- Now 
		more than ever, America needs what you, the Class of 2012, has to 
		offer.&nbsp; America needs you to reach high and hope deeply.&nbsp; And if you 
		fight for your seat at the table, and you set a better example, and you 
		persevere in what you decide to do with your life, I have every faith 
		not only that you will succeed, but that, through you, our nation will 
		continue to be a beacon of light for men and women, boys and girls, in 
		every corner of the globe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So thank you.&nbsp; 
		Congratulations.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; God bless the United 
		States of America.</font></p>
