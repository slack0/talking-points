transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello, hello, hello!&nbsp;Thank you very much. Everybody, please have a seat.&nbsp;Thank 
		you.&nbsp;Hello, Pittsburgh!&nbsp;It is good to be back. Thank 
		you, Senator Casey, and Mayor Ravenstahl, County Executive Dan Onorato, 
		State Auditor Jack Wagner, and all of you for having me back here at 
		Carnegie Mellon.&nbsp;It is good to be here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it seems like 
		every time I'm here I learn something. So, for those of you who are 
		thinking about 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University">
		<font color="#0000FF">Carnegie Mellon</font></a>, it's a terrific place, and you guys are 
		doing just great work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I just met with 
		folks from some cutting-edge companies and saw some of their inventions 
		here in your <a href="http://www.rec.ri.cmu.edu/"><font color="#0000FF">National Robotics Engineering Center</font></a>. But that’s not the 
		only reason I’m here.&nbsp;You might not know this, but one of my 
		responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief is to keep an eye on robots.&nbsp;And I’m pleased to report that the robots you manufacture 
		here seem peaceful -- at least for now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a city that 
		knows something about manufacturing.&nbsp;For generations of Americans, it 
		was the ticket to a middle-class life.&nbsp;Here and across America's 
		industrial heartland, millions clocked in each day at foundries and on 
		assembly lines to make things.&nbsp;And the stuff we made -- steel, cars, 
		planes -- was the stuff that made America what it is. The jobs were 
		good.&nbsp;They paid enough to own a home, to raise kids, send them to 
		college, to retire.&nbsp;They were jobs that told us something more 
		important than just how much money we made, what was in our paycheck.&nbsp;These jobs also told us that we were meeting our responsibilities to our 
		family and to our neighborhoods, and building our communities, and 
		building our country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But for better and 
		worse, our generation has been pounded by wave after wave of profound 
		economic change.&nbsp;Revolutions in technology have transformed the way we 
		live and the way we work. Businesses and industries can relocate 
		anywhere in the world, anywhere that there are skilled workers, anywhere 
		that there is an Internet connection.&nbsp;And companies have learned to 
		become more efficient with fewer employees.&nbsp;In Pittsburgh, you know 
		this as well as anybody -- steel mills that once needed a thousand 
		workers now do the same work with a hundred.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And while these 
		changes have resulted in great wealth for some Americans and have 
		drastically increased productivity, they’ve also caused major 
		disruptions for many others.&nbsp;Today, a high school diploma no longer 
		guarantees you a job.&nbsp;Over the past 13 years, about a third of our 
		manufacturing jobs have vanished.&nbsp;And meanwhile, the typical worker’s 
		wages have barely kept up with the rising costs of everything else.&nbsp;And 
		all this was even before a financial crisis and recession that pounded 
		the middle class even more.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we’ve made some 
		tough decisions that have turned our economy in a positive direction 
		over the past two years. We’ve created more than 2 million new jobs in 
		the private sector over the past 15 months alone, including almost 
		250,000 in manufacturing.&nbsp;But we still have to confront those 
		underlying problems.&nbsp;They weren’t caused overnight, and we won’t solve 
		them overnight.&nbsp;But we will solve them.&nbsp;And we’re starting to solve 
		them right here in Pittsburgh, and right here at Carnegie Mellon.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And by the way, 
		that’s why I ran for President.&nbsp;Not just to get us back to where we 
		were -- I ran for President to get us to where we need to be.&nbsp;I have a 
		larger vision for America -- one where working families feel secure, 
		feel like they are moving forward and that they know that their dreams 
		are within reach; an America where our businesses lead the world in new 
		technologies like clean energy; where we work together, Democrats and 
		Republicans, to live within our means, to cut our deficit and debt, but 
		also to invest in what our economy needs to grow -- world-class 
		education, cutting-edge research, and building the best transportation 
		and communication infrastructure anywhere in the world.&nbsp;That’s what 
		it’s going to take for us to win the future. And winning the future 
		begins with getting our economy moving right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why we’re 
		here.&nbsp;Carnegie Mellon is a great example of what it means to move 
		forward.&nbsp;At its founding, no one would have imagined that a trade 
		school for the sons and daughters of steelworkers would one day become 
		the region’s largest -- one of the region’s largest employers and a 
		global research university.&nbsp;And yet, innovations led by your professors 
		and your students have created more than 300 companies and 9,000 jobs 
		over the past 15 years -- companies like Carnegie Robotics.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But more important 
		than the ideas that you’ve incubated are what those ideas have become:&nbsp;They’ve become products made right here in America and, in many cases, 
		sold all over the world.&nbsp;And that's in our blood. That's who we are. 
		We are inventors, and we are makers, and we are doers. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If we want a robust, 
		growing economy, we need a robust, growing manufacturing sector.&nbsp;That’s 
		why we told the auto industry two years ago that if they were willing to 
		adapt, we’d stand by them.&nbsp;Today, they’re profitable, they’re creating 
		jobs, and they’re repaying taxpayers ahead of schedule.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why we’ve 
		launched a partnership to retrain workers with new skills.&nbsp;That’s why 
		we’ve invested in clean energy manufacturing and new jobs building wind 
		turbines and solar panels and advanced batteries.&nbsp;We have not run out 
		of stuff to make.&nbsp;We’ve just got to reinvigorate our manufacturing 
		sector so that it leads the world the way it always has -- from paper 
		and steel and cars to new products that we haven’t even dreamed up yet.&nbsp;That’s how we’re going to strengthen existing industries; that's how 
		we’re going to spark new ones.&nbsp;That’s how we’re going to create jobs, 
		grow the middle class, and secure our economic leadership.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is why I 
		asked my 
		<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/pcast">
		<font color="#0000FF">Council of Advisors on Science and Technology</font></a> 
		-- what we call PCAST -- a while back to look at the state of American manufacturing and 
		the promise of advanced manufacturing.&nbsp;The concept of advanced 
		manufacturing is not complicated.&nbsp;It means how do we do things better, 
		faster, cheaper to design and manufacture superior products that allow 
		us to compete all over the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so these very 
		smart folks, many of whom are represented here, wrote up a report which 
		is now up on the White House website.&nbsp;But we didn't want to just issue 
		a report, we wanted to actually get something done.&nbsp;So we’ve launched 
		an all-hands-on-deck effort between our brightest academic minds, some 
		of our boldest business leaders, and our most dedicated public servants 
		from science and technology agencies, all with one big goal, and that is 
		a renaissance of American manufacturing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re calling it 
		AMP, A-M-P -- the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership.&nbsp;It’s made up of 
		some of the most advanced engineering universities, like Carnegie 
		Mellon, Georgia Tech, Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan; some of our most 
		innovative manufacturers, from Johnson &amp; Johnson to Honeywell, Stryker 
		to Allegheny Technologies.&nbsp;I’ve asked Susan Hockfield, the President of 
		MIT, who is here -- there’s Susan -- and Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow 
		Chemical -- to lead this partnership, and 
		to work with my own advisors on science, technology and manufacturing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Throughout our 
		history, our greatest breakthroughs have often come from partnerships 
		just like this one.&nbsp;American innovation has always been sparked by 
		individual scientists and entrepreneurs, often at universities like 
		Carnegie Mellon or Georgia Tech or Berkeley or Stanford.&nbsp;But a lot of 
		companies don’t invest in early ideas because it won’t pay off right 
		away. And that’s where government can step in.&nbsp;That’s how we ended up 
		with some of the world-changing innovations that fueled our growth and 
		prosperity and created countless jobs -- the mobile phone, the Internet, 
		GPS, more than 150 drugs and vaccines over the last 40 years was all 
		because we were able to, in strategic ways, bring people together and 
		make some critical investments.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ll take one 
		example.&nbsp;The National Science Foundation helped fund 
		<a href="http://diglib.stanford.edu:8091/"><font color="#0000FF">Stanford’s Digital 
		Library Project</font></a> in the 1990s.&nbsp;The idea was to develop a universal 
		digital library that anybody could access.&nbsp;So two enterprising Ph.D. 
		students got excited about the research that was being done at Stanford 
		-- this is funded by NSF.&nbsp;So these two Ph.D. students, they moved from 
		campus to a friend’s garage, and they launched this company called 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"><font color="#0000FF">Google</font></a>.&nbsp;And when the private sector runs with the ball, it then leads 
		to jobs, building and selling, that is successful all over the world. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This new partnership 
		that we’ve created will make sure tomorrow’s breakthroughs are American 
		breakthroughs.&nbsp;We’re teaming up to foster the kind of 
		collaborative R&amp;D that resulted in those same early discoveries, and to 
		create the kind of innovation infrastructure necessary to get ideas from 
		the drawing board to the manufacturing floor to the market more rapidly 
		-- all of which will make our businesses more competitive and create 
		new, high-quality manufacturing jobs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, to help 
		businesses operate at less cost, the Energy Department will develop new 
		manufacturing processes and materials that use half as much energy. 
		That will free up more money for companies to hire new workers or buy 
		new equipment.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To help businesses 
		discover, develop, and deploy new materials twice as fast, we’re 
		launching what we call the 
		<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/06/24/materials-genome-initiative-renaissance-american-manufacturing">
		<font color="#0000FF">Materials Genome Initiative</font></a>.&nbsp;The invention 
		of silicon circuits and lithium-ion batteries made computers and iPods 
		and iPads possible -- but it took years to get those technologies from 
		the drawing board to the marketplace.&nbsp;We can do it faster.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To help everyone 
		from factory workers to astronauts carry out more complicated tasks, 
		NASA and other agencies will support research into next-generation 
		robotics.&nbsp;And I just met with folks from a local company,
		<a href="http://www.redzone.com/"><font color="#0000FF">RedZone 
		Robotics</font></a>, who make robots that explore water and sewer pipes.&nbsp;And I 
		have to say, it is fascinating stuff, when you watch -- the robot is 
		about this big. It can go through any sewer system.&nbsp;It’s operated 
		remotely by the municipal worker.&nbsp;It’s got a camera attached so it can 
		film everything that it’s seeing. It then transmits the data.&nbsp;It goes 
		into a citywide database, and can enhance the productivity of these 
		workers by three or fourfold, and help the city make even better 
		decisions.&nbsp;Potentially this can save cities millions in infrastructure 
		costs. Companies also are training new workers to operate the robots, 
		and analysts to pore through the data that’s being collected.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To help smaller 
		manufacturers compete, federal agencies are working with private 
		companies to make powerful, often unaffordable modeling and simulation 
		software easier to access.&nbsp;And I just saw an example.&nbsp;A few years ago, 
		Procter &amp; Gamble teamed up with the researchers at Los Alamos National 
		Labs to adapt software developed for war to figure out what’s happening 
		with nuclear particles, and they are using these simulators to 
		dramatically boost the performance of diapers.&nbsp;Yes, 
		diapers.&nbsp;Folks chuckle, but those who’ve been parents -- are always on the lookout for indestructible, military-grade diapers.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But here’s what’s 
		remarkable:&nbsp;Using this simulation software that was developed at Los 
		Alamos, Procter &amp; Gamble has saved 500 million dollars -- half a billion 
		dollars -- as a consequence of this simulator.&nbsp;Now, through the new 
		partnership that we’re setting up, Procter &amp; Gamble is offering its 
		powerful fluid dynamics simulator to smaller manufacturers, and it’s 
		doing it for free. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this is not just 
		because Procter &amp; Gamble wants to do good. It’s also they’ve got 
		thousands of suppliers, and they're thinking to themselves, if we can 
		apply this simulation technology to our smaller suppliers they're going 
		to be able to make their products cheaper and better, then that, in 
		turn, is going to save us even more money. And it has a ripple effect 
		throughout the economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Starting this 
		summer, federal agencies will partner with industries to boost 
		manufacturing in areas critical to our national security.&nbsp; I just saw an 
		example backstage.&nbsp;The Defense Department scientists -- we call it
		<a href="http://www.darpa.mil/"><font color="#0000FF">DARPA</font></a> 
		-- the folks who brought us stealth technology and, by the way, 
		who brought us the Internet -- wanted to see if it was possible to 
		design defense systems cheaper and faster. So they found a small 
		company in Arizona called <a href="https://www.local-motors.com/">
		<font color="#0000FF">Local Motors</font></a>, and they gave them a test:&nbsp; You 
		have one month to design a new combat support vehicle, and you’ve got 
		three months to build it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Their CEO, Jay 
		Rogers, is here today, and as an ex-Marine who lost a couple of buddies 
		in combat, understood the importance of increasing the speed and 
		adaptability and flexibility of our manufacturing process for vehicles 
		that are used in theater.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So Local Motors 
		solicited design ideas on their website, chose the best out of 162 that 
		it received, built and brought this new vehicle here ahead of schedule.&nbsp;We just took a look at it.&nbsp;Not only could this change the way the 
		government uses your tax dollars -- because think about it, instead of 
		having a 10-year lead time to develop a piece of equipment with all 
		kinds of changing specs and a moving target, if we were able to collapse 
		the pace at which that manufacturing takes place, that could save 
		taxpayers billions of dollars.&nbsp;But it also could get products out to 
		theater faster, which could save lives more quickly, and could then be 
		used to transfer into the private sector more rapidly, which means we 
		could get better products and services that we can sell and export 
		around the world.&nbsp;So it’s good for American companies.&nbsp;It’s good for 
		American jobs.&nbsp;It’s good for taxpayers.&nbsp;And it may save some lives in 
		places like Afghanistan for our soldiers.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So that’s what this 
		is all about.&nbsp;As futuristic and, let’s face it, as cool as some of this 
		stuff is, as much as we are planning for America’s future, this 
		partnership is about new, cutting-edge ideas to create new jobs, spark 
		new breakthroughs, reinvigorate American manufacturing today.&nbsp;Right 
		now.&nbsp;Not somewhere off in the future -- right now. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s about making 
		sure our workers and businesses have the skills and the tools they need 
		to compete better, faster, and smarter than anybody else.&nbsp;That's what 
		we’re about.&nbsp;We are America, and we don’t just keep up with changing 
		times, we set the pace for changing times.&nbsp;We adapt; we 
		innovate; we lead the way forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s worth 
		remembering, there was a time when steel was about as advanced as 
		manufacturing got.&nbsp;But when the namesake of this university, 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie">
		<font color="#0000FF">Andrew 
		Carnegie</font></a> -- an immigrant, by the way -- discovered new ways to 
		mass-produce steel cheaply, everything changed.&nbsp;Just 20 years after 
		founding his company, not only was it the largest, most profitable in 
		the world, America had become the number one steelmaker in the world. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, imagine if 
		America was first to develop and mass-produce a new treatment that kills 
		cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched; or solar cells you can 
		brush onto a house for the same cost as paint; or flexible display 
		soldiers -- flexible displays that soldiers can wear on their arms; or a 
		car that drives itself.&nbsp;Imagine how many workers and businesses and 
		consumers would prosper from those breakthroughs. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those things aren’t 
		science fiction -- they’re real.&nbsp;They’re being developed and deployed 
		in labs and factories and on test tracks right now. They sprang from 
		the imagination of students and scientists and entrepreneurs like all of 
		you. And the purpose of this partnership is to prove that the United 
		States of America has your back, is going to be supporting you -- 
		because that’s the kind of adventurous, pioneering spirit that we need 
		right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s the spirit 
		that’s given us the tools and toughness to overcome every obstacle and 
		adapt to every circumstance.&nbsp;And if we remember that spirit, if we 
		combine our creativity, our innovation, and our optimism, if we come 
		together in common cause, as we've done so many times before, then we 
		will thrive again. We will get to where we need to be.&nbsp;And we will 
		make this century the American century just like the last one was. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, 
		everybody.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">God bless you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And God bless the United States 
		of America.</font></p>
