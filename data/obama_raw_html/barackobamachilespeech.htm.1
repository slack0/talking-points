transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Muchas gracias.&nbsp; Thank you 
		so much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; 
		Please, please, everyone be seated.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp; Buenas 
		tardes.&nbsp; It is a wonderful honor to be here in Santiago, Chile.&nbsp; And I 
		want to, first of all, thank your President, President Pinera, for his 
		outstanding leadership and the hospitality that he’s extended not only 
		to me but also to my wife, my daughters, and, most importantly, my 
		mother-in-law.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To the people of 
		Santiago, to the people of Chile, thank you so much for your wonderful 
		welcome.&nbsp; And on behalf of the people of the United States, let me thank 
		you for your friendship and the strong bonds between our people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are several 
		people that I just want to acknowledge very briefly.&nbsp; We have the 
		President of the Inter-American Development Bank, Luis Alberto Moreno, 
		who is here.&nbsp;We also have Alicia Bárcena, who is the 
		Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the 
		Caribbean.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Throughout our 
		history, this land has been called “el fin de la tierra” -- the end of 
		the world.&nbsp; But I’ve come here today because in the 21st century this 
		nation is a vital part of our interconnected world.&nbsp; In an age when 
		peoples are intertwined like never before, Chile shows that we need not 
		be divided by race or religion or ethnic conflict.&nbsp; You’ve welcomed 
		immigrants from every corner of the globe, even as you celebrate a proud 
		indigenous heritage.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At a time when people 
		around the world are reaching for their freedoms, Chile shows that, yes, 
		it is possible to transition from dictatorship to democracy -- and to do 
		so peacefully.&nbsp; Indeed, our marvelous surroundings today, just steps 
		from where Chile lost its democracy decades ago, is a testament to 
		Chile’s progress and its undying democratic spirit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Despite barriers of 
		distance and geography, you’ve integrated Chile into the global economy, 
		trading with countries all over the world and, in this Internet age, 
		becoming the most digitally connected country in Latin America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And in a world of 
		sometimes wrenching pain -- as we’re seeing today in Japan -- it is the 
		character of this country that inspires.&nbsp; “Our original guiding stars,” 
		said Pablo Neruda, “are struggle and hope.”&nbsp; But, he added, “there is no 
		such thing as a lone struggle, no such thing as a lone hope.”&nbsp; The 
		Chilean people have shown this time and again, including your recovery 
		from the terrible earthquake here one year ago.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Credit for Chile’s 
		success belongs to the Chilean people, whose courage, sacrifices and 
		perseverance built this nation into the leader that it is.&nbsp; And we are 
		very honored to be joined today by four leaders who have guided this 
		nation through years of great progress -- Presidents Aylwin, Frei, 
		Lagos, and of course your current President Pinera.&nbsp; Thank you all, to 
		the former Presidents, for being here, as well as President Pinera.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I could not imagine 
		a more fitting place to discuss the new era of partnership that the 
		United States is pursuing not only with Chile, but across the Americas.&nbsp; 
		And I’m grateful that we’re joined by leaders and members of the 
		diplomatic corps from across the region.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Within my first 100 
		days in office, one of my first foreign trips as President, I traveled 
		to Trinidad and Tobago to meet with leaders from across the hemisphere 
		at the Summit of the Americas.&nbsp; And there, I pledged to seek 
		partnerships of equality and shared responsibility, based on mutual 
		interest and mutual respect, but also on shared values.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know I’m not 
		the first president from the United States to pledge a new spirit of 
		partnership with our Latin American neighbors.&nbsp; Words are easy, and I 
		know that there have been times where perhaps the United States took 
		this region for granted.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even now, I know our 
		headlines are often dominated by events in other parts of the world.&nbsp; 
		But let’s never forget:&nbsp; Every day, the future is being forged by the 
		countries and peoples of Latin America.&nbsp; For Latin America is not the 
		old stereotype of a region of -- in perpetual conflict or trapped in 
		endless cycles of poverty.&nbsp; The world must now recognize Latin America 
		for the dynamic and growing region that it truly is.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
		Latin America is at peace.&nbsp; Civil wars have ended.&nbsp; Insurgencies 
		have been pushed back.&nbsp; Old border disputes have been resolved.&nbsp; In 
		Colombia, great sacrifices by citizens and security forces have restored 
		a level of security not seen in decades.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And just as old 
		conflicts have receded, so too have the ideological battles that often 
		fueled them -- the old stale debates between state-run economies and 
		unbridled capitalism; between the abuses of right-wing paramilitaries 
		and left-wing insurgents; between those who believe that the United 
		States causes all the region’s problems and those who believe that the 
		United States ignores all the problems.&nbsp; Those are false choices, and 
		they don’t reflect today’s realities.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, Latin America 
		is democratic.&nbsp; Virtually all the people of Latin America have gone from 
		living under dictatorships to living in democracies.&nbsp; Across the region, 
		we see vibrant democracies, from Mexico to Chile to Costa Rica.&nbsp; We’ve 
		seen historic peaceful transfers of power, from El Salvador to Uruguay 
		to Paraguay.&nbsp; The work of perfecting our democracies, of course, is 
		never truly done, but this is the outstanding progress that’s been made 
		here in the Americas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, Latin America 
		is growing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having made tough but necessary reforms, nations like Peru 
		and Brazil are seeing impressive growth.&nbsp; As a result, Latin America 
		weathered the global economic downturn better than other regions.&nbsp; 
		Across the region, tens of millions of people have been lifted from 
		extreme poverty.&nbsp; From Guadalajara to Santiago to Sao Paolo, a new 
		middle class is demanding more of themselves and more of their 
		governments.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Latin America is 
		coming together to address shared challenges.&nbsp; Chile, Colombia and 
		Mexico are sharing their expertise in security with nations in Central 
		America.&nbsp; When a coup in Honduras threatened democratic progress, the 
		nations of the hemisphere unanimously invoked the Inter-American 
		Democratic Charter, helping to lay the foundation for the return to the 
		rule of law.&nbsp; The contributions of Latin American countries have been 
		critical in Haiti, as has Latin American diplomacy in the lead up to 
		yesterday’s election in Haiti.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And increasingly, 
		Latin America is contributing to global prosperity and security.&nbsp; As 
		longtime contributors to United Nations peacekeeping missions, Latin 
		American nations have helped to prevent conflicts from Africa to Asia.&nbsp; 
		At the G20, nations like Mexico, Brazil, Argentina now have a greater 
		voice in global economic decision-making.&nbsp; Under Mexican leadership, the 
		world made progress at Cancun in our efforts to combat climate change.&nbsp; 
		Nations like Chile have played a leading role in strengthening civil 
		society groups around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is the Latin 
		America that I see today -- a region on the move, proud of its progress, 
		and ready to assume a greater role in world affairs.&nbsp; And for all these 
		reasons, I believe that Latin America is more important to the 
		prosperity and security of the United States than ever before.&nbsp; With no 
		other region does the United States have so many connections.&nbsp; And 
		nowhere do we see that more than in the tens of millions of Hispanic 
		Americans across the United States, who enrich our society, grow our 
		economy and strengthen our nation every single day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I believe Latin 
		America is only going to become more important to the United States, 
		especially to our economy.&nbsp; Trade between the United States and Latin 
		America has surged.&nbsp; We buy more of your products, more of your goods 
		than any other country, and we invest more in this region than any other 
		country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For instance, we 
		export more than three times as much to Latin America as we do to 
		China.&nbsp; Our exports to this region -- which are growing faster than our 
		exports to the rest of the world -- will soon support more than 2 
		million U.S. jobs.&nbsp; In other words, when Latin America is more 
		prosperous, the United States is more prosperous.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But even more than 
		interests, we’re bound by shared values.&nbsp; In each other’s journey we see 
		reflections of our own.&nbsp; Colonists who broke free from empires.&nbsp; 
		Pioneers who opened new frontiers.&nbsp; Citizens who have struggled to 
		expand our nations’ promise to all people -- men and women, white, black 
		and brown.&nbsp; We’re people of faith who must remember that all of us -- 
		especially the most fortunate among us -- must do our part, especially 
		for the least among us.&nbsp; We’re citizens who know that ensuring that 
		democracies deliver for our people must be the work of all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is our common 
		history.&nbsp; This is our common heritage.&nbsp; We are all Americans.&nbsp; Todos 
		somos Americanos.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Across the Americas, 
		parents want their children to be able to run and play and know that 
		they’ll come home safely.&nbsp; Young people all desperately want an 
		education.&nbsp; Fathers want the dignity that comes from work, and women 
		want the same opportunities as their husbands.&nbsp; Entrepreneurs want the 
		chance to start that new business.&nbsp; And people everywhere want to be 
		treated with the respect to which every human being is entitled.&nbsp; These 
		are the hopes -- simple yet profound -- that beat in the hearts of 
		millions across the Americas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But if we’re honest, 
		we’ll also admit that that these dreams are still beyond the reach of 
		too many; that progress in the Americas has not come fast enough.&nbsp; Not 
		for the millions who endure the injustice of extreme poverty.&nbsp; Not for 
		the children in shantytowns and the favelas who just want the same 
		chance as everybody else.&nbsp; Not for the communities that are caught in 
		the brutal grips of cartels and gangs, where the police are outgunned 
		and too many people live in fear.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And despite this 
		region’s democratic progress, stark inequalities endure.&nbsp; In political 
		and economic power that is too often concentrated in the hands of the 
		few, instead of serving the many.&nbsp; In the corruption that too often 
		still stifles economic growth and development, innovation and 
		entrepreneurship.&nbsp; And in some leaders who cling to bankrupt ideologies 
		to justify their own power and who seek to silence their opponents 
		because those opponents have the audacity to demand their universal 
		rights.&nbsp; These, too, are realities that we must face.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, we are not 
		the first generation to face these challenges.&nbsp; Fifty years ago this 
		month, President John F. Kennedy proposed an ambitious Alliance for 
		Progress.&nbsp; It was, even by today’s standards, a massive investment -- 
		billions of U.S. dollars to meet the basic needs of people across the 
		region.&nbsp; Such a program was right -- it was appropriate for that era.&nbsp; 
		But the realities of our time -- and the new capabilities and confidence 
		of Latin America -- demand something different.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">President Kennedy’s 
		challenge endures -- “to build a hemisphere where all people can hope 
		for a sustainable, suitable standard of living, and all can live out 
		their lives in dignity and in freedom.”&nbsp; But half a century later, we 
		must give meaning to this work in our own way, in a new way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believe that in the 
		Americas today, there are no senior partners and there are no junior 
		partners, there are only equal partners.&nbsp; Of course, equal partnerships, 
		in turn, demands a sense of shared responsibility.&nbsp; We have obligations 
		to each other.&nbsp; And today, the United States is working with the nations 
		of this hemisphere to meet our responsibilities in several key areas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, we’re 
		partnering to address the concerns that people across the Americas say 
		they worry about the most -- and that's the security of their families 
		and communities.&nbsp; Criminal gangs and narco-traffickers are not only a 
		threat to the security of our citizens.&nbsp; They’re a threat to 
		development, because they scare away investment that economies need to 
		prosper.&nbsp; And they are a direct threat to democracy, because they fuel 
		the corruption that rots institutions from within.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So with our partners 
		from Colombia to Mexico and new regional initiatives in Central America 
		and the Caribbean, we’re confronting this challenge, together, from 
		every direction.&nbsp; We’ve increased our support -- the equipment, training 
		and technologies -- that security forces, border security and police 
		need to keep communities safe.&nbsp; We’re improving coordination and sharing 
		more information so that those who traffic in drugs and in human beings 
		have fewer places to hide.&nbsp; And we’re putting unprecedented pressure on 
		cartel finances, including in the United States.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we’ll never break 
		the grip of the cartels and the gangs unless we also address the social 
		and economic forces that fuel criminality.&nbsp; We need to reach at-risk 
		youth before they turn to drugs and crime.&nbsp; So we’re joining with 
		partners across the Americas to expand community-based policing, 
		strengthen juvenile justice systems, and invest in crime and drug 
		prevention programs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As the nations of 
		Central American develop a new regional security strategy, the United 
		States stands ready to do our part through a new partnership that puts 
		the focus where it should be -- on the security of citizens.&nbsp; And with 
		regional and international partners, we’ll make sure our support is not 
		just well-intentioned, but is well-coordinated and well-spent.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ve said before and I 
		will repeat, as President I’ve made it clear that the United States 
		shares and accepts our share of responsibility for drug violence.&nbsp; After 
		all, the demand for drugs, including in the United States, drives this 
		crisis.&nbsp; And that’s why we’ve developed a new drug control strategy that 
		focused on reducing the demand for drugs through education and 
		prevention and treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I would point out that even during 
		difficult fiscal times in the United States, we’ve proposed increasing 
		our commitment to these efforts by some $10 billion this year alone.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re also doing more 
		to stem the southbound flow of guns into the region.&nbsp; We’re screening 
		all southbound rail cargo.&nbsp; We’re seizing many more guns bound for 
		Mexico and we’re putting more gunrunners behind bars.&nbsp; And every gun or 
		gunrunner that we take off the streets is one less threat to the 
		families and communities of the Americas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we work to ensure 
		the security of our citizens, we’re partnering in a second area -- and 
		that's promoting prosperity and opportunity.&nbsp; I’ve been so impressed 
		with President Pinera’s pledge to lift everyone out of extreme poverty 
		by 2020.&nbsp; That's an ambitious goal and an appropriate goal.&nbsp; And with 
		this trip, I’m working to expand some of the trade and investment that 
		might help achieve this goal.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Across the region, 
		we’re moving ahead with “open skies” agreements to bring our people and 
		businesses closer together.&nbsp; We’re moving forward with our Trans-Pacific 
		Partnership -- which includes Chile and Peru -- to create new trade 
		opportunities in the fast-growing markets of the Asia-Pacific.&nbsp; And as 
		I’ve directed, my administration has intensified our efforts to move 
		forward on trade agreements with Panama and Colombia, consistent with 
		our values and with our interests.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re also encouraging 
		the next generation of businesses and entrepreneurs.&nbsp; So we’ll work with 
		the Inter-American Development bank to increase lending.&nbsp; We’ve expanded 
		credit under a new Microfinance Growth Fund for the Americas.&nbsp; We’re 
		supporting reforms to tax systems, which are critical for economic 
		growth and public investment.&nbsp; We’re creating new “Pathways to 
		Prosperity” -- microcredit, entrepreneurship training -- for those who 
		must share in economic growth, including women and members of 
		Afro-Caribbean and indigenous communities.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we’re coming 
		together, as a hemisphere, to create clean energy jobs and pursue more 
		secure and sustainable energy futures.&nbsp; And if anybody doubts the 
		urgency of climate change, they look -- they should look no further than 
		the Americas -- from the stronger storms in the Caribbean, to glacier 
		melt in the Andes, to the loss of forests and farmland across the 
		region.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Under the Energy and 
		Climate Partnership of the Americas that I proposed, countries have 
		stepped forward, each providing leadership and expertise.&nbsp; Brazil has 
		expertise in biofuels.&nbsp; Chile in geothermal.&nbsp; Mexico on energy 
		efficiency.&nbsp; El Salvador is connecting grids in Central America to make 
		electricity more reliable.&nbsp; These are exactly the kind of partnerships 
		that we need -- neighbors joining with neighbors to unleash the progress 
		that none of us can achieve alone.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s the same 
		philosophy behind two additional initiatives that I’m announcing today, 
		which will help our countries educate and innovate for the future.&nbsp; 
		First, we’re launching a new initiative to harness the power of social 
		media and online networks to help students, scientists, academics and 
		entrepreneurs collaborate and develop the new ideas and products that 
		will keep America -- the Americas competitive in a global economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I’m proud to 
		announce that the United States will work with partners in this region, 
		including the private sector, to increase the number of U.S. students 
		studying in Latin America to 100,000, and the number of Latin America 
		students studying in the United States to 100,000.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Staying competitive 
		also, of course, demands that we address immigration -- an issue that 
		evokes great passions in the United States as well as in the Americas.&nbsp; 
		As President, I’ve made it clear that immigration strengthens the United 
		States.&nbsp; We are a nation of immigrants, which is why I have consistently 
		spoken out against anti-immigrant sentiment.&nbsp; We’re also a nation of 
		laws, which is why I will not waver in my determination to fix our 
		broken immigration system.&nbsp; I’m committed to comprehensive reform that 
		secures our borders, enforces our laws and addresses the millions of 
		undocumented workers who are living in the shadows of the United States.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believe, though, 
		that this challenge will be with us for a very long time so long as 
		people believe that the only way to provide for their families is to 
		leave their families and head north.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why the 
		United States has to continue to partner with countries that pursue the 
		broad-based economic growth that gives people and nations a path out of 
		poverty.&nbsp; And that’s what we’re seeing here in Chile.&nbsp; As part of our 
		new approach to development, we’re working with partners, like Guatemala 
		and El Salvador, who are committed to building their own capacity -- 
		from helping farmers improve crop yields to helping health care systems 
		to deliver better care.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Which leads me to the 
		final area where we must continue to partner, and that’s strengthening 
		democracy and human rights.&nbsp; More than 60 years ago, our nations came 
		together in an Organization of American States and declared -- and I 
		quote -- that “representative democracy is an indispensable condition 
		for the stability, peace and development of the region.”&nbsp; A decade ago, 
		we reaffirmed this principle, with an Inter-American Democratic Charter 
		that stated -- and I quote -- “the people of the Americas have a right 
		to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and 
		defend it.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Across the Americas, 
		generations, including generations of Chileans, have struggled and 
		sacrificed to give meaning to these words -- ordinary men and women who 
		dared to speak their mind; activists who organized new movements; faith 
		leaders who preached social justice; the mothers of the disappeared who 
		demanded the truth; political prisoners who rose to become presidents; 
		and, even now, Las Damas de Blanco, who march in quiet dignity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The people of the 
		Americas have shown that there is no substitute for democracy.&nbsp; As 
		governments, we have then an obligation to defend what has been won.&nbsp; So 
		as we mark the 10th anniversary of the Inter-American Democratic Charter 
		this year, let’s reaffirm the principles that we know to be true.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let’s recommit to 
		defending democracy and human rights in our own countries by 
		strengthening the institutions that democracy needs to flourish -- free 
		and fair elections in which people choose their own leaders; vibrant 
		legislatures that provide oversight; independent judiciaries that uphold 
		the rule of law; a free press that promotes open debate; professional 
		militaries under civilian control; strong civil societies that hold 
		governments accountable; and governments that are transparent and 
		responsive to their citizens.&nbsp; This is what makes a democracy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And just as we defend 
		democracy and human rights within our borders, let’s recommit to 
		defending them across our hemisphere.&nbsp; I understand, every nation will 
		follow its own path.&nbsp; No nation should impose its will on another.&nbsp; But 
		surely we can agree that democracy is about more than majority rule, 
		that simply holding power does not give a leader the right to suppress 
		the rights of others, and that leaders must maintain power through 
		consent, and not coercion.&nbsp; We have to speak out when we see those 
		principles violated.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let’s never waver in 
		our support for the rights of people to determine their own future -- 
		and, yes, that includes the people of Cuba.&nbsp; Since taking office, I’ve 
		announced the most significant changes to my nation’s policy towards 
		Cuba in decades.&nbsp; I’ve made it possible for Cuban Americans to visit and 
		support their families in Cuba.&nbsp; We’re allowing Americans to send 
		remittances that bring some economic hope for people across Cuba, as 
		well as more independence from Cuban authorities.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Going forward, we’ll 
		continue to seek ways to increase the independence of the Cuban people, 
		who I believe are entitled to the same freedom and liberty as everyone 
		else in this hemisphere.&nbsp; I will make this effort to try to break out of 
		this history that’s now lasted for longer than I’ve been alive.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But Cuban authorities 
		must take some meaningful actions to respect the basic rights of their 
		own people -- not because the United States insists upon it, but because 
		the people of Cuba deserve it, no less than the people of the United 
		States or Chile or Brazil or any other country deserve it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The lessons of Latin 
		America, I believe, can be a guide -- a guide for people around the 
		world who are beginning their own journeys toward democracy.&nbsp; There is 
		no one model for democratic transitions.&nbsp; But as this region knows, 
		successful transitions do have certain ingredients.&nbsp; The moral force of 
		nonviolence.&nbsp; Dialogue that’s open and inclusive.&nbsp; The protection of 
		basic rights, such as peaceful expression and assembly.&nbsp; Accountability 
		for past wrongs.&nbsp; And matching political reform with economic reform, 
		because democracy must meet the basic needs and aspirations of people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With decades of 
		experience, there’s so much Latin America can now share -- how to build 
		political parties and organize free elections; how to ensure peaceful 
		transfers of power; how to navigate the winding paths of reform and 
		reconciliation.&nbsp; And when the inevitable setbacks occur, you can remind 
		people to never lose sight of those guiding stars of which Pablo Neruda 
		spoke -- struggle, but also hope. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Security for our 
		citizens.&nbsp; Trade and development that creates jobs, prosperity and a 
		clean energy future.&nbsp; Standing up for democracy and human rights.&nbsp; These 
		are the partnerships that we can forge together -- here in the Americas 
		but also around the world.&nbsp; And if anyone doubts whether this region has 
		the capacity to meet these challenges, they need to only remember what 
		happened here in Chile only a few months ago.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Their resolve and 
		faith inspired the world -- “Los Treinta y Tres.”&nbsp; I don’t need to tell 
		you the story.&nbsp; You know it well.&nbsp; But it’s worth remembering how this 
		entire nation came together, across government, civilian and military, 
		national and local; across the private sector, with large companies and 
		small shopkeepers donating supplies; and across every segment of Chilean 
		society, people came together to sustain those men down below and their 
		families up at Camp Esperanza.&nbsp; It was a miraculous rescue.&nbsp; It was a 
		tribute to Chilean leadership.&nbsp; And when, finally, Luis Urzua emerged, 
		he spoke for an entire nation when he said, “I am proud to be Chilean.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet something else 
		happened in those two months.&nbsp; The people and governments of Latin 
		America came together to stand with a neighbor in need.&nbsp; And with a 
		Latin American country in the lead, the world was proud to play a 
		supporting role -- sending workers from the United States and Canada, 
		rescue equipment from Europe, communications gear from Asia.&nbsp; And as the 
		miners were lifted to safety, for those joyous reunions, it was a truly 
		global movement, watched and celebrated by more than a billion people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If ever we needed a 
		reminder of the humanity and the hopes that we share, that moment in the 
		desert was such.&nbsp; When a country like Chile puts its mind to it, there’s 
		nothing you can’t do.&nbsp; When countries across Latin America come together 
		and focus on a common goal, when the United States and others in the 
		world do our part, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish together.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that is our vision 
		of the Americas.&nbsp; This is the progress we can achieve together.&nbsp; This is 
		the spirit of partnership and equality to which the United States is 
		committed.&nbsp; I am confident that, working together, there is nothing we 
		cannot achieve.&nbsp; Thank you very much.&nbsp; Muchas gracias.</font></p>
