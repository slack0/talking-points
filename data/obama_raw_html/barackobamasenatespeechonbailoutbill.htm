<font size="1" color="#CE0A04" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, Madam 
		President. And thank you to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut 
		not only for yielding time, but also for the extraordinarily hard work 
		that he's put in over the last several days and, in fact, over a -- a week. 
		And I want to thank his counterparts on the other side, including 
		Senator Gregg, for their hard work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the fact that we're 
		even here voting on a plan to rescue our economy from the greed and 
		irresponsibility of Wall Street and some in Washington is an outrage. 
		It's an outrage to every American who works hard, pays their taxes, is 
		doing their best every day to make a better life for themselves and 
		their families. And understandably, people are frustrated and they're 
		angry that Wall Street's mistakes have put their tax dollars at risk. 
		And they should be. I'm frustrated and angry, too.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But while there's plenty of 
		blame to go around -- and many in Washington and Wall Street who deserve 
		it, all of us -- all of us have a responsibility to solve this crisis, 
		because it affects the financial well-being of every single American. 
		There will be time to punish those who set this fire, but now is not the 
		time to argue about how it got set, or did the neighbor sleep in his 
		bed, or leave the stove on. Right now we want to put out that fire; and 
		now's the time for us to come together and do that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Economic_Stabilization_Act_of_2008#First_House_vote.2C_September_29">
		<font color="#0000FF">House of 
		Representatives failed to act</font></a> on Monday, we saw the
		<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/30markets.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">
		<font color="#0000FF">single largest 
		decline in the stock market in two decades</font></a>. Over one trillion dollars of wealth 
		was lost by the time the markets closed. And it wasn't just the wealth 
		of a few CEOs or Wall Street executives. The 401(k)s and retirement 
		accounts of millions became smaller. The state pension funds of teachers 
		and government employees lost billions upon billions of dollars. 
		Hard-working Americans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow saw 
		it diminish and in some cases disappear.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And while that decline was 
		devastating, the consequences of 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007–08">
		<font color="#0000FF">the credit crisis</font></a> that caused it will 
		be even worse if we do not act now. We're in a very dangerous situation, 
		where financial institutions across this country are afraid to lend 
		money. And if all that meant was the failure of a few banks in New York, 
		that would be one thing. But that's not what it means. What it means is, 
		if we don't act, it will be harder for Americans to get a mortgage for 
		their home or loans they need to buy a car or send their children to 
		college.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What it means is that 
		businesses won't be able to get the loans they need to open a new 
		factory or make payroll for their workers. And if they can't make 
		payroll on Friday, then workers are laid off on Monday. And if workers 
		are laid off on Monday, then they can't pay their bills or pay back 
		their loans to somebody else. And it will go on and on and on, rippling 
		through the entire economy. And potentially we could see thousands of 
		businesses close, millions of jobs could be lost, and a long and painful 
		recession could follow. In other words, this is not 
		just a Wall Street crisis; it's an American crisis. And it's the 
		American economy that needs this rescue plan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I understand completely why 
		people would be skeptical when this President asks for a blank check to 
		solve this problem. I was, too, as was Senator Dodd and a whole bunch of 
		us here. And that's why, over a week ago, I demanded that this plan 
		include some specific proposals to protect taxpayers, protections that 
		the Administration eventually agreed 
		to, and, thanks to the hard work of Senator Dodd and Republican 
		counterparts like Senator Gregg, we here in the Senate have agreed to, 
		and now hopefully the House will agree to, as well.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me just go over those 
		principles:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Number one, I said we needed 
		an independent board to provide oversight and accountability for how and 
		where this money is spent at every step of the way.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Number two, I said that we 
		cannot help banks on Wall Street without helping the millions of 
		innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes. They 
		deserve a plan, too.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Number three, I said that I 
		would not allow this plan to become a welfare program for Wall Street 
		executives, whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess.</font></p>
			<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, finally, I said that, 
		if American taxpayers are financing this solution, then they have to be 
		treated like investors. They should get every penny of their tax dollars 
		back once the economy recovers.</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this last part is 
		important, because it's been the most misunderstood and poorly 
		communicated part of this plan. This is not a plan to just hand over 
		700 billion dollars of taxpayer money to a few banks. If this is managed correctly 
		-- and that's an important &quot;if&quot; -- we will hopefully get most or all of 
		our money back and possibly even turn a profit on the government's 
		intervention, every penny of which will go directly back to the American 
		people. And if we fall short, we 
		will levy a fee on financial institutions so that they can repay for the 
		losses that they caused.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let me -- let's acknowledge, even 
		with all these taxpayer protections, this plan is not perfect. Democrats 
		and Republicans in Congress have legitimate concerns about it. Some of 
		my closest colleagues, people I have the greatest respect for, still 
		have problems with it and may choose to vote against this bill, and I 
		think that we can respectfully disagree. I understand their 
		frustrations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also know that many -- 
		many 
		Americans share their concerns. But it's clear that, from my 
		perspective, this is what we need to do right now to prevent the 
		possibility of a crisis turning into a catastrophe. It is conceivable -- it's 
		possible that if we did nothing everything would turn out okay. It's -- 
		There -- There's a possibility that that's true. And there's no doubt that there 
		may be other plans out there that, had we had two or three or six months 
		to develop, might be even more refined and might serve our purposes 
		better.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we don't have that kind 
		of time. And we can't afford to take a risk that the economy of the 
		United States of America and, as a consequence, the worldwide economy 
		could be plunged into a very, very deep hole. So to Democrats and 
		Republicans who've opposed this plan, I say: Step up to the plate. Let's 
		do what's right for the country at this time, because the time to act is 
		now.</font></p>
		<font size="2" face="Arial">

			</font>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know many Americans are 
		wondering what happens next. And passing this bill can't be the end of 
		our work to strengthen our economy; it must be the beginning. Because one thing 
		I -- I think 
		all of us who may end up supporting this bill understand is that, even 
		if we get this in place, we could still have enormous problems and 
		probably will have big problems in the economy over the next several 
		months and potentially longer; because the fact is, is that we have seen 
		some mismanagement of the fundamentals of the economy for a very long 
		time, and we are not going to dig ourselves out of that hole 
		immediately.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is not the end. This 
		is the beginning. As soon as we pass this 
		rescue plan, we need to move aggressively with the same sense of urgency 
		to rescue families on Main Street who are struggling to pay their bills 
		and keep their jobs. They've been in crisis a lot longer than Wall 
		Street has.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've said it before and I 
		say it again: We need to pass an economic stimulus package that will 
		help ordinary Americans cope with rising food and gas prices, that can 
		save one million jobs rebuilding our schools, and roads, and our 
		infrastructure, and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax 
		increase[s], a -- a plan that would extend expiring unemployment benefits for 
		those Americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones. That's the right thing to do 
		at a time when consumer confidence is down and we are in great danger of 
		slipping into a big recession.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also must do more in this 
		rescue package in order to help homeowners stay in their homes. I will 
		continue to advocate bankruptcy reforms. I know my colleague from 
		Illinois, Dick Durbin, has been a strong champion of this, as have many. It is the right thing to do 
		to change our bankruptcy laws so that people have a better chance of 
		staying in their homes and we're not seeing communities devastated all 
		across the country. And we should encourage Treasury to study the option of 
		buying individual mortgages, like we did successfully in the 1930s.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, while we all 
		hope that this rescue package succeeds, we should be prepared to take 
		more vigorous actions in the months ahead to rebuild capital, if it's 
		necessary.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, just as families are 
		planning for their future in tough times, Washington's going to have to 
		do the same. Runaway spending and record deficits are not how families 
		run their budgets. It can't be how Washington handles people's tax 
		dollars. So we're going to have to 
		return to the fiscal responsibility we had in the 1990s. And the next 
		White House and the next Congress is going to have to work together to 
		make sure that we go through our budget, we get rid of programs that 
		don't work, that we make the ones that do work better and cost less. With less money flowing into 
		the Treasury, some useful programs or policies might need to be delayed. 
		And some might be -- need to be stretched out over a longer period of time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there are certain 
		investments in our future that we cannot delay, precisely because our 
		economy is in turmoil.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, I've exceeded 
		the time a little bit. I would like unanimous consent for a couple more 
		minutes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="1">[Cross talk from the Floor]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Senate President</u>: Is there 
		objection? Seeing no objection -- </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><u>Senator Obama</u>: Thank you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are certain 
		investments in our future that we can't delay precisely be -- because the 
		economy's in turmoil. We can't wait to help Americans keep up with 
		rising costs and shrinking paychecks, and we're going to do that by 
		making sure that we are giving our workers a middle-class tax cut.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can't wait to relieve the 
		burden of crushing health care costs. We can't wait to create millions 
		of new jobs by rebuilding our roads and our bridges, and investing in 
		broadband lines in rural communities, and fixing our electricity grid so 
		we can get renewable energy to population centers that need them. And we need to develop an 
		energy policy that prevents us from sending 700 billion dollars a year to 
		tyrants and dictators for their oil. We can't wait to educate the 
		next generation of Americans with the skills and knowledge they need to 
		compete with any workers anywhere in the world. These are the priorities we 
		cannot delay.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let me just close by 
		saying this: I do not think this is going to be easy. It's not going to 
		come without costs. We are all going to need to sacrifice. We're all going to need to 
		pull our weight, because now, more than ever, we are all in this 
		together. That's part of what 
		this crisis has taught us -- that in the end of the day, there's no real 
		separation between Wall Street and Main Street. There's only the road 
		we're traveling on as Americans. And we will rise or fall on 
		that journey as one nation and as one people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that many Americans 
		are feeling anxiety right now about their jobs, about their homes, about 
		their life savings. But I also know this, that we can steer ourselves 
		out of this crisis. We are -- always have. During the great financial 
		crisis of the last century, in his 
		<a href="../fdrfirstfiresidechat.html"><font color="#0000FF">first fireside chat</font></a>, FDR told his 
		fellow Americans that, </font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is an element in the re-adjustment of our 
		financial system more important than currency, more important than gold, 
		and that is the confidence of the people themselves. Confidence and 
		courage are the essentials of success in carrying out our plan.</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us unite in banishing 
		fear. Together we cannot fail. We cannot fail, not now, not tomorrow, 
		not next year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a nation that's faced down war and depression, 
		great challenges and great threats. And at each and every 
		moment, we have risen to meet up these challenges, not as Democrats, not 
		as Republicans, but as Americans, with resolve and with confidence, with 
		that fundamental belief that, here in America, our destiny is not 
		written for us, it's written by us. And that's who we are. And 
		that's the country I know we can be right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank again the 
		extraordinary leadership of Chairman Dodd and Banking --&nbsp; the Banking Committee, as 
		well as Chairman Baucus and Majority Leader Reid. They have worked 
		tirelessly. I want to thank the leadership in the House of 
		Representatives.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I urge my colleagues to join 
		me in supporting this important legislation, understanding that this 
		will not solve all our problems. It is a necessary but not sufficient 
		step to make sure that this economy once again works on behalf of all 
		Americans in their pursuit of the American dream.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, Mr. President. I 
		yield the floor.</font></p>
