<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you!&nbsp; Everybody, please have a set.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To Leader Reid, to Steny 
		Hoyer, John Larson, Xavier Becerra, Jim Clyburn, Chris Van Hollen, to an 
		extraordinary leader and extraordinary Speaker of the House, Nancy 
		Pelosi, and to all the members here today, thank you very much for 
		having me.&nbsp; Thanks for having me and thanks for your 
		tireless efforts waged on behalf of health insurance reform in this 
		country.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have the great pleasure of 
		having a really nice library at the White House.&nbsp; And I was tooling 
		through some of the writings of some previous Presidents and I came upon 
		this quote by Abraham Lincoln:&nbsp; “I am not bound to win, but I’m bound to 
		be true.&nbsp; I’m not bound to succeed, but I’m bound to live up to what 
		light I have.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This debate has been a 
		difficult debate.&nbsp; This process has been a difficult process.&nbsp; And this 
		year has been a difficult year for the American people.&nbsp; When I was 
		sworn in, we were in the midst of the worst recession since the Great 
		Depression.&nbsp; Eight hundred thousand people per month were losing their 
		jobs.&nbsp; Millions of people were losing their health insurance.&nbsp; And the 
		financial system was on the verge of collapse.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this body has taken on 
		some of the toughest votes and some of the toughest decisions in the 
		history of Congress.&nbsp; Not because you were bound to win, but because you 
		were bound to be true.&nbsp; Because each and every one of you made a 
		decision that at a moment of such urgency, it was less important to 
		measure what the polls said than to measure what was right.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A year later, we’re in 
		different circumstances.&nbsp; Because of the actions that you’ve taken, the 
		financial system has stabilized.&nbsp; The stock market has stabilized.&nbsp; 
		Businesses are starting to invest again.&nbsp; The economy, instead of 
		contracting, is now growing again.&nbsp; There are signs that people are 
		going to start hiring again.&nbsp; There’s still tremendous hardship all 
		across the country, but there is a sense that we are making progress -- 
		because of you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But even before this crisis, 
		each and every one of us knew that there were millions of people across 
		America who were living their own quiet crises.&nbsp; Maybe because they had 
		a child who had a preexisting condition and no matter how desperate they 
		were, no matter what insurance company they called, they couldn’t get 
		coverage for that child.&nbsp; Maybe it was somebody who had been forced into 
		early retirement, in their 50s not yet eligible for Medicare, and they 
		couldn’t find a job and they couldn’t find health insurance, despite the 
		fact that they had some sort of chronic condition that had to be tended 
		to.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Every single one of you 
		at some point before you arrived in Congress and after you arrived in 
		Congress have met constituents with heart-breaking stories.&nbsp; And you’ve 
		looked them in the eye and you’ve said, we’re going to do something 
		about it -- that’s why I want to go to Congress.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And now, we’re on the 
		threshold of doing something about it.&nbsp; We’re a day away.&nbsp; After a year 
		of debate, after every argument has been made, by just about everybody, 
		we’re 24 hours away.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As some of you know, I’m not 
		somebody who spends a lot of time surfing the cable channels, but I’m 
		not completely in the bubble.&nbsp; I have a sense of what the coverage has 
		been, and mostly it’s an obsession with “What will this mean for the 
		Democratic Party?&nbsp; What will this mean for the President’s polls?&nbsp; How 
		will this play out in November?&nbsp; Is this good or is this bad for the 
		Democratic majority?&nbsp; What does it mean for those swing districts?”&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I noticed that there’s 
		been a lot of friendly advice offered all across town.&nbsp; Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, Karl Rove -- they’re all warning you of 
		the horrendous impact if you support this legislation.&nbsp; Now, it could be 
		that they are suddenly having a change of heart and they are deeply 
		concerned about their Democratic friends.&nbsp;They are giving 
		you the best possible advice in order to assure that Nancy Pelosi 
		remains Speaker and Harry Reid remains Leader and that all of you keep 
		your seats.&nbsp; That’s a possibility.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But it may also be possible 
		that they realize after health reform passes and I sign that legislation 
		into law, that it’s going to be a little harder to mischaracterize what 
		this effort has been all about.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because this year, small 
		businesses will start getting tax credits so that they can offer health 
		insurance to employees who currently don’t have it.&nbsp;Because this year, those same parents who are worried about getting 
		coverage for their children with preexisting conditions now are assured 
		that insurance companies have to give them coverage -- this year.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because this year, insurance 
		companies won’t suddenly be able to drop your coverage when you get sick 
		-- or impose lifetime limits or restrictive limits on the 
		coverage that you have.&nbsp; Maybe they know that this year, for the first 
		time, young people will be able to stay on their parents’ health 
		insurance until they’re 26 years old and they’re thinking that just 
		might be popular all across the country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And what they also know is 
		what won’t happen.&nbsp; They know that after this legislation passes and 
		after I sign this bill, lo and behold nobody is pulling the plug on 
		Granny.&nbsp;It turns out that in fact people who like their 
		health insurance are going to be able to keep their health insurance; 
		that there’s no government takeover.&nbsp; People will discover that if they 
		like their doctor, they’ll be keeping their doctor.&nbsp; In fact, they’re 
		more likely to keep their doctor because of a stronger system.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’ll turn out that this 
		piece of historic legislation is built on the private insurance system 
		that we have now and runs straight down the center of American political 
		thought.&nbsp; It turns out this is a bill that tracks the recommendations 
		not just of Democrat Tom Daschle, but also Republicans Bob Dole and 
		Howard Baker; that this is a middle-of-the-road bill that is designed to 
		help the American people in an area of their lives where they urgently 
		need help.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there are some who 
		wanted a single-payer government-run system.&nbsp; That’s not this bill.&nbsp; The 
		Republicans wanted what I called the “foxes guard the henhouse approach” 
		in which we further deregulate the insurance companies and let them run 
		wild, the notion being somehow that that was going to lower costs for 
		the American people.&nbsp; I don’t know a serious health care economist who 
		buys that idea, but that was their concept.&nbsp; And we rejected that, 
		because what we said was we want to create a system in which health care 
		is working not for insurance companies but it’s working for the American 
		people, it’s working for middle class families.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what did we do?&nbsp; What is 
		the essence of this legislation?&nbsp; Number one, this is the toughest 
		insurance reforms in history.&nbsp;We are making sure that the 
		system of private insurance works for ordinary families.&nbsp; A prescription 
		-- this is a patient’s bill of rights on steroids.&nbsp; So many of you 
		individually have worked on these insurance reforms -- they are in this 
		package -- to make sure that families are getting a fair deal; that if 
		they’re paying a premium, that they’re getting a good service in return; 
		making sure that employers, if they are paying premiums for their 
		employees, that their employees are getting the coverage that they 
		expect; that insurance companies are not going to game the system with 
		fine print and rescissions and dropping people when they need it most, 
		but instead are going to have to abide by some basic rules of the road 
		that exemplify a sense of fairness and good value.&nbsp; That’s number one.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second thing this does 
		is it creates a pool, a marketplace, where individuals and small 
		businesses, who right now are having a terrible time out there getting 
		health insurance, are going to be able to purchase health insurance as 
		part of a big group -- just like federal employees, just like members of 
		Congress.&nbsp; They are now going to be part of a pool that can negotiate 
		for better rates, better quality, more competition.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why the 
		Congressional Budget Office says this will lower people’s rates for 
		comparable plans by 14 to 20 percent. That’s not my numbers -- that’s 
		the Congressional Budget Office’s numbers.&nbsp; So that people will have 
		choice and competition just like members of Congress have choice and 
		competition.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Number three, if people 
		still can’t afford it we’re going to provide them some tax credits -- 
		the biggest tax cut for small businesses and working families when it 
		comes to health care in history.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And number four, this is the 
		biggest reduction in our deficit since the Budget Balance Act -- one of 
		the biggest deficit reduction measures in history -- over $1.3 trillion 
		that will help put us on the path of fiscal responsibility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s before we count 
		all the game-changing measures that are going to assure, for example, 
		that instead of having five tests when you go to the doctor you just get 
		one; that the delivery system is working for patients, not just working 
		for billings.&nbsp; And everybody who’s looked at it says that every single 
		good idea to bend the cost curve and start actually reducing health care 
		costs are in this bill.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So that’s what this effort 
		is all about.&nbsp; Toughest insurance reforms in history.&nbsp; A marketplace so 
		people have choice and competition who right now don’t have it and are 
		seeing their premiums go up 20, 30, 40, 50 percent.&nbsp; Reductions in the 
		cost of health care for millions of American families, including those 
		who have health insurance.&nbsp; The Business Roundtable did their own study 
		and said that this would potentially save employers $3,000 per employee 
		on their health care because of the measures in this legislation.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And by the way, not only 
		does it reduce the deficit -- we pay for it responsibly in ways that the 
		other side of the aisle that talks a lot about fiscal responsibility but 
		doesn’t seem to be able to walk the walk can’t claim when it comes to 
		their prescription drug bill.&nbsp; We are actually doing it.&nbsp; This is paid for and will not add a dime to the deficit -- it will 
		reduce the deficit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, is this bill perfect?&nbsp; 
		Of course not.&nbsp; Will this solve every single problem in our health care 
		system right away?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; There are all kinds of ideas that many of you 
		have that aren’t included in this legislation.&nbsp; I know that there has 
		been discussion, for example, of how we’re going to deal with regional 
		disparities and I know that there was a meeting with Secretary Sebelius 
		to assure that we can continue to try to make sure that we’ve got a 
		system that gives people the best bang for their buck.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is not -- there are 
		all kinds of things that many of you would like to see that isn’t in 
		this legislation.&nbsp; There are some things I’d like to see that’s not in 
		this legislation.&nbsp; But is this the single most important step that we 
		have taken on health care since Medicare?&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Is this the most 
		important piece of domestic legislation in terms of giving a break to 
		hardworking middle class families out there since Medicare?&nbsp; 
		Absolutely.&nbsp; Is this a vast improvement over the status quo?&nbsp; 
		Absolutely.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I still know this is a 
		tough vote, though.&nbsp; I know this is a tough vote.&nbsp; I’ve talked to many 
		of you individually.&nbsp; And I have to say that if you honestly believe in 
		your heart of hearts, in your conscience, that this is not an 
		improvement over the status quo; if despite all the information that’s 
		out there that says that without serious reform efforts like this one 
		people’s premiums are going to double over the next five or 10 years, 
		that folks are going to keep on getting letters from their insurance 
		companies saying that their premium just went up 40 or 50 percent; if 
		you think that somehow it’s okay that we have millions of hardworking 
		Americans who can’t get health care and that it’s all right, it’s 
		acceptable, in the wealthiest nation on Earth that there are children 
		with chronic illnesses that can’t get the care that they need -- if you 
		think that the system is working for ordinary Americans rather than the 
		insurance companies, then you should vote no on this bill.&nbsp; If you can 
		honestly say that, then you shouldn’t support it.&nbsp; You’re here to 
		represent your constituencies and if you think your constituencies 
		honestly wouldn’t be helped, you shouldn’t vote for this.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But if you agree that the 
		system is not working for ordinary families, if you’ve heard the same 
		stories that I’ve heard everywhere, all across the country, then help us 
		fix this system.&nbsp; Don't do it for me.&nbsp; Don’t do it for Nancy Pelosi or 
		Harry Reid.&nbsp; Do it for all those people out there who are struggling.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of you know I get 10 
		letters a day that I read out of the 40,000 that we receive.&nbsp; Started 
		reading some of the ones that I got this morning.&nbsp; “Dear President 
		Obama, my daughter, a wonderful person, lost her job.&nbsp; She has no health 
		insurance.&nbsp; She had a blood clot in her brain.&nbsp; She’s now disabled, 
		can’t get care.”&nbsp; “Dear President Obama, I don’t yet qualify for 
		Medicare.&nbsp; COBRA is about to run out.&nbsp; I am desperate, don't know what 
		to do.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Do it for them.&nbsp; Do it for 
		people who are really scared right now through no fault of their own, 
		who’ve played by the rules, who’ve done all the right things, and have 
		suddenly found out that because of an accident, because of an ailment, 
		they’re about to lose their house; or they can’t provide the help to 
		their kids that they need; or they’re a small business who up until now 
		has always taken pride in providing care for their workers and it turns 
		out that they just can’t afford to do it anymore and they’ve having to 
		make a decision about do I keep providing health insurance for my 
		workers or do I just drop their coverage or do I not hire some people 
		because I simply can’t afford it -- it’s all being gobbled up by the 
		insurance companies.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Don’t do it for me.&nbsp; Don’t 
		do it for the Democratic Party.&nbsp; Do it for the American people.&nbsp; They’re 
		the ones who are looking for action right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know this is a tough 
		vote.&nbsp; And I am actually confident -- I’ve talked to some of you 
		individually -- that it will end up being the smart thing to do 
		politically because I believe that good policy is good politics.&nbsp; 
		I am convinced that when you go out there and you are 
		standing tall and you are saying I believe that this is the right thing 
		to do for my constituents and the right thing to do for America, that 
		ultimately the truth will out.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I had a wonderful 
		conversation with Betsy Markey.&nbsp; I don't know if Betsy is around here.&nbsp; 
		There she is right there.&nbsp; Betsy is in a tough district.&nbsp; 
		The biggest newspaper is somewhat conservative, as Betsy described.&nbsp; 
		They weren’t real happy with health care reform.&nbsp; They were opposed to 
		it.&nbsp; Betsy, despite the pressure, announced that she was in favor of 
		this bill.&nbsp; And lo and behold, the next day that same newspaper runs an 
		editorial saying, you know what, we’ve considered this, we’ve looked at 
		the legislation, and we actually are pleased that Congresswoman Markey 
		is supporting the legislation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I see John Boccieri 
		stand up proud with a whole bunch of his constituencies --  
		in as tough a district as there is and stand up with a bunch of folks 
		from his district with preexisting conditions and saying, you know, I 
		don’t know what is going on Washington but I know what’s going on with 
		these families -- I look at him with pride.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I can’t guarantee that 
		this is good politics.&nbsp; Every one of you know your districts better than 
		I do.&nbsp; You talk to folks.&nbsp; You’re under enormous pressure.&nbsp; You’re 
		getting robocalls.&nbsp; You’re getting e-mails that are tying up the 
		communications system.&nbsp; I know the pressure you’re under.&nbsp; I get a few 
		comments made about me.&nbsp; I don’t know if you’ve noticed.&nbsp;  
		I’ve been in your shoes.&nbsp; I know what it’s like to take a tough vote.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But what did Lincoln say?&nbsp; 
		“I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true.”&nbsp; Two generations 
		ago, folks who were sitting in your position, they made a decision -- we 
		are going to make sure that seniors and the poor have health care 
		coverage that they can count on.&nbsp; And they did the right thing.&nbsp; </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I’m sure at the time 
		they were making that vote, they weren’t sure how the politics were 
		either, any more than the people who made the decision to make sure that 
		Social Security was in place knew how the politics would play out, or 
		folks who passed the civil rights acts knew how the politics were going 
		to play out.&nbsp; They were not bound to win, but they were bound to be 
		true.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And now we’ve got middle 
		class Americans, don’t have Medicare, don’t have Medicaid, watching the 
		employer-based system fray along the edges or being caught in terrible 
		situations.&nbsp; And the question is, are we going to be true to them?&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sometimes I think about how 
		I got involved in politics.&nbsp; I didn’t think of myself as a potential 
		politician when I get out of college.&nbsp; I went to work in neighborhoods, 
		working with Catholic churches in poor neighborhoods in Chicago, trying 
		to figure out how people could get a little bit of help.&nbsp; And I was 
		skeptical about politics and politicians, just like a lot of Americans 
		are skeptical about politics and politicians are right now.&nbsp; Because my 
		working assumption was when push comes to shove, all too often folks in 
		elected office, they’re looking for themselves and not looking out for 
		the folks who put them there; that there are too many compromises; that 
		the special interests have too much power; they just got too much clout; 
		there’s too much big money washing around.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I decided finally to get 
		involved because I realized if I wasn’t willing to step up and be true 
		to the things I believe in, then the system wouldn’t change.&nbsp; Every 
		single one of you had that same kind of moment at the beginning of your 
		careers.&nbsp; Maybe it was just listening to stories in your neighborhood 
		about what was happening to people who’d been laid off of work.&nbsp; Maybe 
		it was your own family experience, somebody got sick and didn’t have 
		health care and you said something should change.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Something inspired you to 
		get involved, and something inspired you to be a Democrat instead of 
		running as a Republican.&nbsp; Because somewhere deep in your heart you said 
		to yourself, I believe in an America in which we don’t just look out for 
		ourselves, that we don’t just tell people you’re on your own, that we 
		are proud of our individualism, we are proud of our liberty, but we also 
		have a sense of neighborliness and a sense of community -- and we are willing to look out for one another and help people who are 
		vulnerable and help people who are down on their luck and give them a 
		pathway to success and give them a ladder into the middle class.&nbsp; That’s 
		why you decided to run.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And now a lot of us have 
		been here a while and everybody here has taken their lumps and their 
		bruises.&nbsp; And it turns out people have had to make compromises, and 
		you’ve been away from families for a long time and you’ve missed special 
		events for your kids sometimes.&nbsp; And maybe there have been times where 
		you asked yourself, why did I ever get involved in politics in the first 
		place?&nbsp; And maybe things can’t change after all.&nbsp; And when you do 
		something courageous, it turns out sometimes you may be attacked.&nbsp; And 
		sometimes the very people you thought you were trying to help may be 
		angry at you and shout at you.&nbsp; And you say to yourself, maybe that 
		thing that I started with has been lost.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But you know what?&nbsp; Every 
		once in a while, every once in a while a moment comes where you have a 
		chance to vindicate all those best hopes that you had about yourself, 
		about this country, where you have a chance to make good on those 
		promises that you made in all those town meetings and all those 
		constituency breakfasts and all that traveling through the district, all 
		those people who you looked in the eye and you said, you know what, 
		you’re right, the system is not working for you and I’m going to make it 
		a little bit better.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is one of those 
		moments.&nbsp; This is one of those times where you can honestly say to 
		yourself, doggone it, this is exactly why I came here.&nbsp; This is why I 
		got into politics.&nbsp; This is why I got into public service.&nbsp; This is why 
		I’ve made those sacrifices.&nbsp; Because I believe so deeply in this country 
		and I believe so deeply in this democracy and I’m willing to stand up 
		even when it’s hard, even when it’s tough.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Every single one of you have 
		made that promise not just to your constituents but to yourself.&nbsp; And 
		this is the time to make true on that promise.&nbsp; We are not bound to win, 
		but we are bound to be true.&nbsp; We are not bound to succeed, but we are 
		bound to let whatever light we have shine.&nbsp; We have been debating health 
		care for decades.&nbsp; It has now been debated for a year.&nbsp; It is in your 
		hands.&nbsp; It is time to pass health care reform for America, and I am 
		confident that you are going to do it tomorrow.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, House 
		of Representatives.&nbsp; Let’s get this done.</font></p>
