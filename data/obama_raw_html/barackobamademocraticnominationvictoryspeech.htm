transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you....Thank you. What a -- 
What a wonderful reception. Thank you, Saint Paul. Thank you, Minnesota. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, 
<a href="http://www.professionalbusinesswriting.com/aboutjoann.aspx">
<font color="#0000FF">JoAnn Syverson</font></a>, for 
the wonderful introduction.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, Michelle Obama and 
Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Thank you to my brothers and sisters. Thank you to 
-- Thank you to my staff. Thank you to our volunteers. Thank you to my political 
team. Thank you to our campaign manager,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Plouffe"><font color="#0000FF">David 
Plouffe</font></a>, who never gets any credit, but has built the best political 
organization in the country.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you to my grandmother, who 
helped raise me, and is sitting in Hawaii somewhere right now because she can't 
travel, but who poured everything she had into me, and who helped to make me the 
man I am today. Tonight is for her.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tonight, Minnesota, after 54 
hard-fought contests, our primary season has finally come to an end. Sixteen -- 
Sixteen months have passed since <a href="barackobamacandidacyforpresident.htm">
<font color="#0000FF">we 
first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol</font></a> in Springfield, 
Illinois. Thousands of miles have been traveled; millions of voices have been 
heard.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And because of what you said, 
because you decided that change must come to Washington, because you believed 
that this year must be different than all the rest, because -- because you chose to listen 
not to your doubts or your fears, but to your greatest hopes and highest 
aspirations, tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning 
of another, a journey -- a journey that will bring a new and better day to 
America.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because of you, tonight I can stand 
here and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for the President of the 
United States of America.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I want to -- I want to 
thank -- I want to thank -- I want to thank all those in Montana and South Dakota who stood up for change today. I 
want to thank every American who stood with us over the course of this campaign, 
through the good days and the bad, from the snows of Cedar Rapids to the 
sunshine of Sioux Falls.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And, tonight, I also want to thank 
the men and woman who took this journey with me as fellow candidates for 
President. You know, at this defining moment -- At this 
defining moment for our nation, we should be proud that our Party put forth one 
of the most talented, qualified field of individuals ever to run for office. I have not just competed with them 
as rivals. I’ve learned from them as friends, as public servants, and as 
patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this 
country better. They are leaders of this Party and leaders that America will 
turn to for years to come.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that is particularly true for 
the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else: Senator 
Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign. She has made history not -- 
not just 
because she’s a woman who has done what no woman has done before, but because 
she is a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength, her 
courage, and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight. I congratulate her on her victory in 
South Dakota, and I congratulate her on the race that she has run throughout 
this contest.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We’ve certainly had our differences 
over the last 16 months. But as someone who’s shared a stage with her many 
times, I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning -- even 
in the face of tough odds -- is exactly what sent her and Bill Clinton to sign 
up for their first campaign in Texas all those years ago, what sent her to work 
at the Children’s Defense Fund and made her fight for health care as first lady, 
what led her to the United States Senate and fueled her barrier-breaking 
campaign for the presidency: an unyielding desire to improve the lives of 
ordinary Americans, no matter how difficult the fight may be.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And you can rest assured that when 
we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country -- and we 
will win that fight -- she will be central to that victory. When we transform our energy policy 
and lift our children out of poverty, it will be because she worked to help make 
it happen. Our Party and our country are better 
off because of her, and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to 
compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are those who say that this 
primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided. Well, I say that, because 
of this primary, there are millions of Americans who've cast their ballot for 
the very first time. There are -- There are Independents and 
Republicans who understand this election isn’t just about a change of Party in 
Washington, but also about the need to change Washington. There are -- There are young people, and 
African-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans, and women of all ages who have voted 
in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of you chose to support a 
candidate you believe in deeply. But at the end of the day, we aren’t the reason 
you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your 
voice heard. You didn’t do that -- You didn’t do 
that because of me or Senator Clinton or anyone else. You did it because you 
know in your hearts that at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, 
we cannot afford to keep doing what we’ve been doing. We owe our children a better future. 
We owe our country a better future. And for all those who dream of that future 
tonight, I say: Let us begin the work together. Let us unite in common effort to 
chart a new course for America.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In just -- In just a few short months, the 
Republican Party will arrive in St. Paul with a very different agenda. They will 
-- They will come here to nominate John McCain, a man who has served this country heroically. I honor, we honor the service of 
John McCain, and I respect his many accomplishments, even if he chooses to deny 
mine. My -- My differences with him -- My 
differences with him are not personal. They are with the policies he has 
proposed in this campaign, because while John McCain can legitimately tout 
moments of independence from his Party in the past, such independence has not 
been the hallmark of his presidential campaign.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s not change when John McCain 
decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the 
Senate last year.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s not change when he offers four 
more years of Bush economic policies that have failed to create well-paying 
jobs, or insure our workers, or help Americans afford the skyrocketing cost of 
college, policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average American 
family, and widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street, and left our 
children with a mountain of debt.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s not change when he promises to 
continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in 
uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians, a policy where all we look for are 
reasons to stay in Iraq, while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war 
that isn’t making the American people any safer. So -- So, I’ll say this: There are many 
words to describe John McCain’s attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bush’s 
policies as bipartisan and new, but “change” is not one of them. “Change” is not one of them, because 
change is a foreign policy that doesn’t begin and end with a war that should’ve 
never been authorized and never been waged.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I won’t stand here and pretend that 
there are many good options left in Iraq, but what’s not an option is leaving 
our troops in that country for the next hundred years, especially at a time when 
our military is overstretched, our nation is isolated, and nearly every other 
threat to America is being ignored. We -- We must be -- We must be as careful getting out of 
Iraq as we were careless getting in, but we -- but start leaving we must. It’s time for Iraqis to take 
responsibility for their future. It’s time to rebuild our military and give our 
veterans the care and the benefits they deserve when they come home.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s time -- It's time to refocus our efforts on 
Al Qaida’s leadership and Afghanistan, and rally the world against the common 
threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and 
poverty, genocide and disease. That’s what change is.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Change -- Change, Minnesota, is realizing that 
meetings [sic] today’s threats requires not just our firepower, but the power of our 
diplomacy: tough -- tough, direct diplomacy, where the President of the United States 
isn’t afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we 
stand for. We must once again have the courage 
and the conviction to lead the free world. That is the legacy of Roosevelt and 
Truman and Kennedy. That’s what the American people demand. That’s what change 
is.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Change is building an economy that 
rewards not just wealth, but the work and the workers who created it. It’s 
understanding that the struggles facing working families can’t be solved by 
spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy 
CEOs, but by giving a middle-class tax break to those who need it, and investing 
in our crumbling infrastructure, and transforming how we use energy, and 
improving our schools, and renewing our commitment to science and innovation. It’s understanding that fiscal 
responsibility and shared prosperity can go hand-in-hand, as they did when Bill 
Clinton was President.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">John McCain has spent a lot of time 
talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks, but maybe if he spent some 
time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this 
economy -- cities in Michigan, and Ohio, and right here in Minnesota -- he’d 
understand the kind of change that people are looking for.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe if he went to Iowa and met the 
student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can’t pay 
the medical bills for a sister who’s ill, he’d understand she can’t afford four 
more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the 
wealthy. She needs us to pass health care 
right now, a plan that guarantees insurance to every American who wants it and 
brings down premiums for every family who needs it. That’s the change we need, 
Minnesota.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe -- Maybe if John McCain went to 
Pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job, but can’t even afford the gas 
to drive around and look for a new one, he’d understand we can’t afford four 
more years of our addiction to oil from dictators. That man needs us to pass an energy 
policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards, and makes 
corporations pay for their pollution, and oil companies invest their record 
profits in a clean energy future, an energy policy that will create millions of 
new jobs that pay well and can’t be outsourced. That’s the change we need, 
Minnesota.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And maybe if John McCain spent some 
time in the schools of South Carolina or St. Paul, Minnesota, or 
<a href="johnmccainrepublicannominationspeech.htm"><font color="#0000FF">where he spoke 
tonight in New Orleans, Louisiana</font></a>, he’d understand that we can’t afford to leave 
the money behind for <i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act">
<font color="#0000FF">No Child Left Behind</font></a></i>; that we owe it to our children to 
invest in early-childhood education; and recruit an army of new teachers and 
give them better pay and more support; and finally decide that, in this global 
economy, the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the 
few, but a birthright of every American. That’s the change we need in 
America. That’s why I’m running for President of the United States.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now -- Now, the other side will come here 
in September and offer a very different set of policies and positions, and that 
is a good thing. That is a debate I look forward to. It is a debate that the American 
people deserve on the issues that will help determine the future of this country 
and the future for our children. But what you don’t deserve is 
another election that’s governed by fear, and innuendo, and division. What you 
won’t hear from this campaign or this Party is the kind of politics that uses 
religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon. What you won’t see from this 
campaign or this Party is a politics that sees our opponents not as competitors 
to challenge, but enemies to polarize, because we may call ourselves Democrats 
and Republicans, but we are Americans first. We are always Americans first.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite -- Despite what the good senator from 
Arizona may have said tonight, I’ve seen people of differing views and opinions 
find common cause many times during my two decades in public life, and I’ve 
brought many together myself. I’ve walked arm-in-arm with 
community leaders on the south side of Chicago and watched tensions fade as 
black and white and Latino fought together for good jobs and good schools. I’ve sat across the table from law 
enforcement officials and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice 
system that sent 13 innocent people to death row. I’ve worked with friends in the 
other Party to provide more children with health insurance and more working 
families with a tax break, to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that 
the American people know where their tax dollars are being spent, and to reduce the 
influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in Washington.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In our country -- In our country, I have found that 
this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything, but because, behind 
all the false labels and false divisions and categories that define us, beyond 
all the petty bickering and point-scoring in Washington, Americans are a decent, 
generous, compassionate people, united by common challenges and common hopes.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And every so often, there are 
moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great 
again. So it was for that band of patriots 
who declared in a Philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union, and 
for all those who gave on the fields of Gettysburg and Antietam their last full 
measure of devotion to save that same union. So it was for the greatest 
generation that conquered <a href="fdrfirstinaugural.html">
<font color="#0000FF">fear itself</font></a>, and liberated a continent from tyranny, 
and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity. So it was for the workers who stood 
out on the picket lines, the women who shattered glass ceilings, the children 
who braved a Selma bridge for freedom’s cause. So it has been for every generation 
that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave 
their children a world that’s better and kinder and more just.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so it must be for us.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">America, this is our moment. This is 
our time, our time to turn the page on the policies of the past, our time to 
bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face, our time to offer a 
new direction for this country that we love.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The journey will be difficult. The 
road will be long. I face this challenge -- I face this challenge with profound 
humility and knowledge of my own limitations, but I also face it with limitless 
faith in the capacity of the American people.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because if we are willing to work 
for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that, 
generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that 
this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to 
the jobless.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This was the moment when the rise 
of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This was the moment when we ended 
a war, and secured our nation, and restored our image as the 
<a href="jfkinaugural.htm"><font color="#0000FF">last, best hope</font></a> on 
Earth.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This was the moment, this was the 
time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always 
reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you, Minnesota. God bless you.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
