<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, thank you, Leon, and 
		thank you, Jim.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When I chose Leon Panetta 
		as Director of the CIA, I said he was going to be a strong advocate for 
		this agency and would strengthen your capabilities to meet the threats 
		of our time.&nbsp;And when I chose Jim Clapper as Director of National 
		Intelligence, I charged him with making sure that our intelligence 
		community works as one integrated team.&nbsp; That’s exactly what these two 
		leaders have done, along with all of you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, Jim and Leon, thank 
		you for your remarkable leadership, not just in recent weeks, but during 
		the entirety of your tenure. You have done a great job.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is my third visit 
		here to Langley as President, and each of these visits has marked 
		another milestone in our mission to protect the American people and keep 
		our country safe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On my first visit, just 
		months after taking office, I stood here and I said that this agency and 
		our entire intelligence community is fundamental to America’s national 
		security.&nbsp;I said that I believed that your best days were still to come 
		and I pledged that you would have my full support to carry out your 
		critical work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soon after that visit, I 
		called Leon into the Oval Office and I directed him to make the killing 
		or capture of Osama bin Laden the top priority in our war to defeat al 
		Qaeda.&nbsp;And he came back here, and you guys, who had already been 
		working so hard on this issue, redoubled your efforts.&nbsp;And that was 
		true all across the intelligence community.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">My second visit, a year 
		later, came under more somber circumstances.&nbsp; We gathered to pay tribute 
		to seven American patriots who gave their lives in this fight at a 
		remote post in Afghanistan.&nbsp;As has already been mentioned, their stars 
		now grace this memorial wall.&nbsp;And through our grief and our tears, we 
		resolved that their sacrifice would be our summons to carry on their 
		work, to complete this mission, to win this war.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Today I’ve returned just 
		to say thank you, on behalf of all Americans and people around the 
		world, because you carried on.&nbsp;You stayed focused on your mission.&nbsp;You 
		honored the memory of your fallen colleagues.&nbsp;And in helping to locate 
		and take down Osama bin Laden, you made it possible for us to achieve 
		the most significant victory yet in our war to defeat al Qaeda.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I just met with some of 
		the outstanding leaders and teams from across the community who worked 
		so long and so hard to make that raid a success.&nbsp;And I’m pleased today 
		that we’re joined by representatives from all of our intelligence 
		agencies, and that folks are watching this live back at all of those 
		agencies, because this truly was a team effort.&nbsp; That’s not always the 
		case in Washington.&nbsp;But all of you work together every single day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is one of the few 
		times when all these leaders and organizations have the occasion to 
		appear together publicly.&nbsp;And so I thank all of you for coming -- 
		because I think it’s so important for the American people to see all of 
		you here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Part of the challenge of 
		intelligence work is, by necessity, your work has to remain secret.&nbsp;I 
		know that carries a heavy burden.&nbsp;You’re often the first ones to get 
		the blame when things go wrong, and you’re always the last ones to get 
		the credit when things go right.&nbsp;So when things do go right -- and they 
		do more often than the world will ever know -- we ought to celebrate 
		your success.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s why I came here.&nbsp;I 
		wanted every single one of you to know, whether you work at the CIA or 
		across the community, at every step of our effort to take out bin Laden, 
		the work you did and the quality of the intelligence that you provided 
		made the critical difference -- to me, to our team on those helicopters, 
		to our nation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After I directed that 
		getting bin Laden be the priority, you hunkered down even more, building 
		on years of painstaking work; pulling together, in some cases, the 
		slenderest of intelligence streams, running those threads to ground 
		until you found that courier and you tracked him to that compound.&nbsp;And 
		when I was briefed last summer, you had built the strongest intelligence 
		case against -- in terms of where 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tora_Bora">
		<font color="#0000FF">bin Laden was since Tora Bora</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the months that 
		followed, including all those meetings in the Situation Room, we did 
		what sound intelligence demands:&nbsp;We pushed for more collection.&nbsp;We 
		pushed for more evidence.&nbsp;We questioned our assumptions.&nbsp;You 
		strengthened your analysis.&nbsp;You didn’t bite your tongue and try to spin 
		the ball, but you gave it to me straight each and every time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And we did something 
		really remarkable in Washington -- we kept it a secret.&nbsp;That’s how it 
		should be.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamaciahq3.jpg" width="309" height="205"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course, when the time 
		came to actually make the decision, we didn’t know for sure that bin 
		Laden was there.&nbsp;The evidence was circumstantial and the risks, 
		especially to the lives of our special operations forces, were huge.&nbsp;And I knew that the consequences of failure could be enormous.&nbsp;But I 
		made the decision that I did because I had absolute confidence in the 
		skill of our military personnel and I had confidence in you.&nbsp; I put my 
		bet on you.&nbsp;And now the whole world knows that that faith in you was 
		justified.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So just as impressive as 
		what you did was how you did it.&nbsp;It was a tribute to your perseverance, 
		your relentless focus and determination over many years.&nbsp;For the fight 
		against al Qaeda did not begin on 9/11.&nbsp; Among you are veterans who’ve 
		been pursuing these murderers for many years, even before they 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_United_States_embassy_bombings">
		<font color="#0000FF">attacked 
		our embassies in Africa</font></a> and struck
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cole_bombing">
		<font color="#0000FF">the [USS] Cole in Yemen</font></a>.&nbsp;Among you are 
		young men and women for whom 9/11 was a call to service.&nbsp;This fight has 
		defined your generation.&nbsp;And on this wall are stars honoring all your 
		colleagues and friends, more than a dozen who have given their lives in 
		the fight against al Qaeda and its violent allies.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the years wore on, 
		others began to think that this terrorist might never be brought to 
		justice. But you never quit.&nbsp;You never gave up.&nbsp;You pulled together 
		across this agency and across the community.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No one piece of 
		information and no one agency made this possible.&nbsp;You did it together 
		-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA"><font color="#0000FF">CIA</font></a>,
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency">
		<font color="#0000FF">National Security Agency</font></a>,
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office">
		<font color="#0000FF">National Reconnaissance Office</font></a>, the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geospatial_Intelligence_Agency">
		<font color="#0000FF">National Geospatial Intelligence Agency</font></a>, everyone at
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODNI#Office_of_the_Director_of_National_Intelligence_.28ODNI.29">
		<font color="#0000FF">ODNI</font></a> and the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Counterterrorism_Center">
		<font color="#0000FF">National Counterterrorism Center</font></a>.&nbsp;Folks across the country, civilian 
		and military, so many of you here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that’s exactly how our 
		intelligence community is supposed to work, using every capability -- 
		human, technical -- collecting, analyzing, sharing, integrating 
		intelligence, and then acting on it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s what made this one 
		of the greatest intelligence successes in American history, and that’s 
		why intelligence professionals are going to study and be inspired by 
		your achievement for generations to come.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, make no mistake -- 
		this is not over.&nbsp;Because we not only took out the symbol and 
		operational leader of al Qaeda, we walked off with his files -- the 
		largest treasure trove of intelligence ever seized from a terrorist 
		leader.&nbsp;Many of you now are working around the clock; you didn’t have 
		much time to celebrate.&nbsp;We’ve got to analyze and evaluate and exploit 
		this mountain of intelligence.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So today, every terrorist 
		in the al Qaeda network should be watching their back, because we’re 
		going to review every video, we are going to examine every photo, we’re 
		going to read every one of those millions of pages, we’re going to 
		pursue every lead.&nbsp;We are going to go wherever it takes us.&nbsp;We’re 
		going to finish the job.&nbsp;We are going to defeat al Qaeda.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even as we stay focused on 
		this mission, we need you to stay nimble and flexible to meet the full 
		range of threats to our security, from plots against our homeland to 
		nations seeking weapons of mass destruction to transnational threats 
		such as cyber criminals and narco-trafficers.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So I’m going to keep 
		relying on you -- for your intelligence, the analysis that comes across 
		my desk every single day.&nbsp;And 300-plus [million] Americans are counting on you to 
		stay a step ahead of our adversaries and to keep our country safe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have never been more 
		proud or more confident in you than I am today -- not just because this 
		extraordinary success, but because it reminds us of who we are as a 
		people and as a nation.&nbsp;You reminded us that when we Americans set our 
		mind to something, when we are focused and when we are working together, 
		when we’re not worried about who’s getting the credit and when we stay 
		true to our values, even if it takes years, there is nothing we cannot 
		do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s why I still believe 
		in what I said my first visit here two years ago:&nbsp; Your greatest days 
		are still to come.&nbsp;And if any of you doubt what this means, I wish I 
		could have taken some of you on the trip I made to New York City, where 
		we laid a wreath at <font color="#0000FF">
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">
		<font color="#0000FF">Ground Zero</font></a></font>, and I had a chance to meet firefighters 
		who had lost an entire shift; police officers who had lost their 
		comrades; a young woman, 14 years old, who had written to me because her 
		last memory of her father was talking to him on the phone while her 
		mother wept beside her, right before they watched the tower go down.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And she and other members 
		of families of 9/11 victims talked about what this meant. It meant that 
		their suffering had not been forgotten, and that the American community 
		stands with them, that we stand with each other.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So most of you will never 
		get headlines for the work that you do.&nbsp;You won’t get ticker-tape 
		parades. But as you go about your work with incredible diligence and 
		dedication every single day, I hope all of you understand how important 
		it is, how grateful I am, and that you have the thanks of a grateful 
		nation.</font></p>
