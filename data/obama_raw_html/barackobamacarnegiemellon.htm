		<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank 
		you very much.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me begin by thanking Dr. 
		Jared Cohon, and the entire Carnegie Mellon community, for welcoming me 
		once again, and for the terrific work that he and the administration, 
		faculty and staff do here each and every day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also want to acknowledge 
		your outstanding mayor -- who doesn’t look any older than the last time 
		I saw him -- Mayor Luke Ravenstahl.&nbsp; There he is, right there.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is great to be back at 
		Carnegie Mellon, and in the beautiful city of Pittsburgh.&nbsp; I love 
		visiting a good sports town.&nbsp; Last year, I stole Dan Rooney to serve as 
		my ambassador to Ireland.&nbsp; To make it up, I invited both 
		the Steelers and the Penguins to the White House to celebrate their 
		championships.&nbsp; Seeing how the Blackhawks are headed to 
		Philly tonight with a 2-0 lead in the Stanley Cup Finals, I'm just glad 
		that we're on this side of the state.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I noticed a couple of people 
		said they were rooting for the Blackhawks, which tells me something 
		about the rivalry between Pittsburgh and Philly.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, we meet here at 
		an incredibly difficult time for America.&nbsp; Among other things, it’s a 
		time when the worst environmental disaster of its kind in our nation’s 
		history is threatening the Gulf Coast and the people who live there.&nbsp; 
		Right now, stopping this oil spill and containing its damage is 
		necessarily the top priority not just of my Administration but I think 
		of the entire country.&nbsp; And we’re waging this battle every minute of 
		every day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But at the same time, we’re 
		continuing our efforts to recover and rebuild from an economic disaster 
		that has touched the lives of nearly every American.&nbsp; That’s what I want 
		to talk about today -- the state of our economy, the future we must 
		seize, and the path we chose to get there.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It has now been a little 
		over 16 months since I took office amid one of the worst economic storms 
		in our history.&nbsp; And to navigate that storm, my Administration was 
		forced to take some dramatic and unpopular steps.&nbsp; These steps have 
		succeeded in breaking the freefall.&nbsp; We’re again moving in the right 
		direction.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">An economy that was 
		shrinking at an alarming rate when I became President has now been 
		growing for three consecutive quarters.&nbsp; After losing an average of 
		750,000 jobs a month during the winter of last year, we’ve now added 
		jobs for five of the last six months, and we expect to see strong job 
		growth in Friday’s report.&nbsp; The taxpayer money it cost to shore up the 
		financial sector and the auto industry, that's being repaid.&nbsp; And both 
		GM and Chrysler are adding shifts and operating at a profit. So, despite 
		temporary setbacks, uncertain world events, and the resulting ups and 
		downs of the market, this economy is getting stronger by the day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, that doesn’t mean this 
		recession is by any means over for the millions of Americans who are 
		still looking for a job or a way to pay the bills.&nbsp; Not by a long shot.&nbsp; 
		The devastation created by the deepest downturn since the Great 
		Depression has hit people and communities across our country very hard.&nbsp; 
		And it’s not going to be a real recovery until people can feel it in 
		their own lives.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the immediate future, 
		this means doing whatever is necessary to keep the recovery going and to 
		spur job growth.&nbsp; But in the long term, it means recognizing that for a 
		lot of middle-class families -- for entire communities, in some case -- 
		a sense of economic security has been missing since long before the 
		recession began.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over the last decade, these 
		families saw their income decline.&nbsp; They saw the cost of things like 
		health care and college tuition reach record highs.&nbsp; They lived through 
		a so-called economic “expansion” that generated slower job growth than 
		at any prior expansion since World War II.&nbsp; Some people have called the 
		last 10 years “the lost decade.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the anxiety that’s out 
		there today isn’t new.&nbsp; The recession has certainly made it worse, but 
		that feeling of not being in control of your own economic future -- that 
		sense that the American Dream might slowly be slipping away -- that’s 
		been around for some time now.&nbsp; And for better or for worse, our 
		generation of Americans has been buffeted by tremendous forces of 
		economic change.&nbsp; Long gone are the days when a high school diploma 
		could guarantee a job at a local factory -- not when so many of those 
		factories had moved overseas.&nbsp; Pittsburgh, a city that once was defined 
		by the steel industry, knows this better than just about anybody.&nbsp; And 
		today, the ability of jobs and entire industries to relocate where 
		there’s skilled workers and an Internet connection has forced America to 
		compete like never before.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">From China to India to 
		Europe, other nations have already realized this.&nbsp; They’re putting a 
		greater emphasis on math and science, and demanding more from their 
		students.&nbsp; Some countries are building high-speed railroads and 
		expanding broadband access. They’re making serious investments in 
		technology and clean energy because they want to win the competition for 
		those jobs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we can’t afford to stand 
		pat while the world races by.&nbsp; The United States of America did not 
		become the most prosperous nation on Earth by sheer luck or 
		happenstance.&nbsp; We got here because each time a generation of Americans 
		has faced a changing world, we have changed with it.&nbsp; We have not feared 
		our future; we have shaped it.&nbsp; America does not stand still; we move 
		forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's why I’ve said 
		that as we emerge from this recession, we can’t afford to return to the 
		pre-crisis status quo.&nbsp; We can’t go back to an economy that was too 
		dependent on bubbles and debt and financial speculation.&nbsp; We can’t 
		accept economic growth that leaves the middle class owing more and 
		making less.&nbsp; We have to build a new and stronger foundation for growth 
		and prosperity -- and that’s exactly what we’ve been doing for the last 
		16 months.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s a foundation based on investments in our people and their future; 
		investments in the skills and education we need to compete; investments 
		in a 21st century infrastructure for America, from high-speed railroads 
		to high-speed Internet; investments in research and technology, like 
		clean energy, that can lead to new jobs and new exports and new 
		industries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This new foundation is also 
		based on reforms that will make our economy stronger and our businesses 
		more competitive -- reforms that will make health care cheaper, our 
		financial system more secure, and our government less burdened with 
		debt.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a global economy, we 
		can’t pursue this agenda in a vacuum.&nbsp; At the height of the financial 
		crisis, the coordinated action we took with the nations of the G20 
		prevented a global depression and helped restore worldwide growth.&nbsp; And 
		as we’ve recently witnessed in Europe, economic difficulties in one part 
		of the world can affect everybody else.&nbsp; And that’s why we have to keep 
		on working with the nations of the G20 to pursue more balanced growth.&nbsp; 
		That’s why we need to coordinate financial reform with other nations so 
		that we avoid a global race to the bottom.&nbsp; It’s why we need to open new 
		markets and meet the goal of my National Export Initiative:&nbsp; to double 
		our exports over the next five years.&nbsp; And it’s why we need to ensure 
		that our competitors play fair and our agreements are enforced.&nbsp; This, 
		too, is part of building a new foundation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, some of you may have 
		noticed that we have been building this foundation without much help 
		from our friends in the other party.&nbsp; From our efforts to rescue the 
		economy, to health insurance reform, to financial reform, most have sat 
		on the sidelines and shouted from the bleachers.&nbsp; They said no to tax 
		cuts for small businesses; no to tax credits for college tuition; no to 
		investments in clean energy.&nbsp; They said no to protecting patients from 
		insurance companies and consumers from big banks.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And some of this, of course, 
		is just politics.&nbsp; Before I was even inaugurated, the congressional 
		leaders of the other party got together and made a calculation that if I 
		failed, they’d win. So when I went to meet with them about the need for 
		a Recovery Act, in the midst of crisis, they announced they were against 
		it before I even arrived at the meeting.&nbsp; Before we even had a health 
		care bill, a Republican senator actually said, “If we’re able to stop 
		Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo.&nbsp; It will break him.”&nbsp; So those 
		weren’t very hopeful signs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But to be fair, a good deal 
		of the other party’s opposition to our agenda has also been rooted in 
		their sincere and fundamental belief about the role of government.&nbsp; It’s 
		a belief that government has little or no role to play in helping this 
		nation meet our collective challenges.&nbsp; It’s an agenda that basically 
		offers two answers to every problem we face:&nbsp;more tax breaks for the 
		wealthy and fewer rules for corporations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The last Administration 
		called this recycled idea “<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/convention2004/georgewbush2004rnc.htm"><font color="#0000FF">the Ownership Society</font></a>.”&nbsp; But what it 
		essentially means is that everyone is on their own.&nbsp; No matter how hard 
		you work, if your paycheck isn’t enough to pay for college or health 
		care or childcare, well, you’re on your own.&nbsp; If misfortune causes you 
		to lose your job or your home, you’re on your own.&nbsp; And if you’re a Wall 
		Street bank or an insurance company or an oil company, you pretty much 
		get to play by your own rules, regardless of the consequences for 
		everybody else.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I’ve never believed 
		that government has all the answers.&nbsp; Government cannot and should not 
		replace businesses as the true engine of growth and job creation.&nbsp; 
		Government can’t instill good values and a sense of responsibility in 
		our children.&nbsp; That's a parent’s job.&nbsp; Too much government can deprive 
		us of choice and burden us with debt.&nbsp; Poorly designed regulations can 
		choke off competition and the capital that businesses need to thrive.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I understand these 
		arguments.&nbsp; And it’s reflected in my policies.&nbsp; After all, one-third of 
		the Recovery Act we designed was made up of tax cuts for families and 
		small businesses.&nbsp; And when you think back to the health care debate, 
		despite calls for a single-payer, government-run health care plan, we 
		passed reform that maintains our system of private health insurance.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I also understand that 
		throughout our nation’s history, we have balanced the threat of 
		overreaching government against the dangers of an unfettered market.&nbsp; 
		We've provided a basic safety net, because any one of us might 
		experience hardship at some time in our lives and may need some help 
		getting back on our feet.&nbsp; And we've recognized that there have been 
		times when only government has been able to do what individuals couldn't 
		do and corporations wouldn't do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's how we have railroads 
		and highways, public schools and police forces.&nbsp; That's how we've made 
		possible scientific research that has led to medical breakthroughs like 
		the vaccine for Hepatitis B, and technological wonders like GPS.&nbsp; That's 
		how we have Social Security and a minimum wage, and laws to protect the 
		food we eat and the water we drink and the air that we breathe.&nbsp; That’s 
		how we have rules to ensure that mines are safe and, yes, that oil 
		companies pay for the spills that they cause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there have always been 
		those who’ve said no to such protections; no to such investments.&nbsp; There 
		were accusations that Social Security would lead to socialism, and that 
		Medicare was a government takeover.&nbsp; There were bankers who claimed the 
		creation of federal deposit insurance would destroy the industry.&nbsp; And 
		there were automakers who argued that installing seatbelts was 
		unnecessary and unaffordable.&nbsp; There were skeptics who thought that 
		cleaning our water and our air would bankrupt our entire economy.&nbsp; And 
		all of these claims proved false.&nbsp; All of these reforms led to greater 
		security and greater prosperity for our people and our economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what was true then is 
		true today.&nbsp; As November approaches, leaders in the other party will 
		campaign furiously on the same economic arguments they’ve been making 
		for decades.&nbsp; Fortunately, we don't have to look back too many years to 
		see how their agenda turns out.&nbsp; For much of the last 10 years we've 
		tried it their way.&nbsp; They gave us tax cuts that weren’t paid for to 
		millionaires who didn’t need them.&nbsp; They gutted regulations and put 
		industry insiders in charge of industry oversight.&nbsp; They shortchanged 
		investments in clean energy and education, in research and technology.&nbsp; 
		And despite all their current moralizing about the need to curb 
		spending, this is the same crowd who took the record $237 billion 
		surplus that President Clinton left them and turned it into a record 
		$1.3 trillion deficit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we know where those ideas 
		lead us.&nbsp; And now we have a choice as a nation.&nbsp; We can return to the 
		failed economic policies of the past, or we can keep building a stronger 
		future. We can go backward, or we can keep moving forward.&nbsp; And I don't 
		know about you, but I want to move forward.&nbsp; I think America wants to 
		move forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the first step in 
		building a new foundation that allows us to move forward has been to 
		address the costs and risks that have made our economy less competitive 
		-- outdated regulations, crushing health care costs, and a growing debt.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To start with, we can't 
		compete as a nation if the irresponsibility of a few folks on Wall 
		Street can bring our entire economy to its knees.&nbsp; That's why we're on 
		the verge of passing the most sweeping financial reform since the Great 
		Depression.&nbsp; It’s a reform that will help prevent another AIG.&nbsp; It will 
		end taxpayer-funded bank bailouts.&nbsp; It contains the strongest consumer 
		protections in history -- protections that will empower Americans with 
		the clear and concise information they need before signing up for a 
		credit card or taking out a mortgage.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Financial reform will not 
		guard against every instance of greed and irresponsibility on Wall 
		Street.&nbsp; But it will enshrine a new principle in our financial system:&nbsp; 
		From now on, instead of competing to see who can come up with the 
		cleverest scheme to make the quickest buck, financial institutions will 
		compete to see who can make the better product and the better service.&nbsp; 
		And that's a competition that benefits Wall Street and Main Street.&nbsp; 
		That’s why we need to get this legislation done.&nbsp; It’s why we can’t 
		afford to go back; we have to move forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also know we can’t 
		compete in a global economy if our citizens are forced to spend more and 
		more of their income on medical bills; if our businesses are forced to 
		choose between health care and hiring; if state and federal budgets are 
		weighed down with skyrocketing health care costs.&nbsp; That’s why we finally 
		passed health insurance reform.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let’s be clear.&nbsp; The 
		costs of health care are not going to come down overnight just because 
		legislation passed, and in an ever-changing industry like health care, 
		we’re going to continuously need to apply more cost-cutting measures as 
		the years go by.&nbsp; But once this reform is in full effect, middle-class 
		families will pay less for their health care, and the worst practices of 
		the insurance industry will end.&nbsp; People with preexisting medical 
		conditions will no longer be excluded from coverage.&nbsp; People who become 
		seriously ill will no longer be thrown off their coverage for reasons 
		contrived by the insurance company.&nbsp; Taxpayers will no longer have to 
		pay -- in the form of higher premiums -- for trips to the ER by 
		uninsured Americans.&nbsp; Businesses will get help with their health care 
		costs.&nbsp; In fact, small businesses are already learning they’re eligible 
		for tax credits to cover their workers this year.&nbsp; And with less waste 
		and greater efficiency in the system, this reform will do more to bring 
		down the deficit than any step we have taken in more than a decade.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The other party has staked 
		their claim this November on repealing these health insurance reforms 
		instead of making them work.&nbsp; They want to go back.&nbsp; We need to move 
		forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Making health care more 
		cost-efficient is critical, because it’s also true that we cannot be 
		competitive as a nation if we remain dragged down by our growing debt.&nbsp; 
		So let me talk about debt just for a second.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">By the time I took office, 
		we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of 
		$8 trillion over the next decade.&nbsp; Most of this was the result of not 
		paying for two major tax cuts skewed to the wealthy, and a worthy but 
		expensive prescription drug program that wasn’t paid for.&nbsp; I always find 
		it interesting that the same people who participated in these decisions 
		are the ones who now charge our Administration with fiscal 
		irresponsibility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the truth is if I had 
		taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to 
		start bringing down the deficits that they created.&nbsp; But we took office 
		amid a crisis, and the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole 
		in our budget before I even walked through the door.&nbsp; Additionally, the 
		steps that we had to take to save the economy from depression 
		temporarily added more to the deficit -- by about $1 trillion.&nbsp; Of 
		course, if we had spiraled into a depression, our deficits and debt 
		levels would be much worse.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the economy is still 
		fragile, so we can’t put on the brakes too quickly.&nbsp; We have to do what 
		it takes to ensure a strong recovery.&nbsp; A growing economy will 
		unquestionably improve our fiscal health, as will the steps we take in 
		the short-term to put Americans back to work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why I signed a 
		bill that will provide tax cuts for small businesses that hire 
		unemployed workers.&nbsp; That's why I’ve urged Congress to pass a small 
		business lending fund so that small businesses can get the credit they 
		need to create jobs and grow.&nbsp; That's why I believe it’s critical we 
		extend unemployment insurance for several more months, so that Americans 
		who’ve been laid off through no fault of their own get the support they 
		need to provide for their families and can maintain their health 
		insurance until they’re rehired.&nbsp; And we have to work with state and 
		local governments to make sure they have the resources to prevent the 
		likely layoffs of hundreds of thousands of public school teachers across 
		the country over the next few months.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But as we look ahead, we 
		can’t lose sight of the urgent need to get our fiscal house in order.&nbsp; 
		There are four key components to putting our budget on a sustainable 
		path.&nbsp; Maintaining economic growth is number one.&nbsp; Health care reform is 
		number two. The third component is the belt-tightening steps I’ve 
		already outlined to reduce our deficit by $1 trillion.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Starting in 2011, we will 
		enact a three-year freeze on all discretionary spending outside of 
		national security -- something that was never enacted in the last 
		Administration.&nbsp; We will allow the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans 
		to expire.&nbsp; We’ve gone through the budget, line by line, and identified 
		more than 120 programs for elimination.&nbsp; We’ve restored a simple 
		budgeting rule that every family and business understands called 
		pay-as-you-go. And we will charge the largest Wall Street firms a fee to 
		repay the American people for rescuing them during the financial crisis 
		-- a fee that will bring down the deficit by $90 billion -- a fee that will bring down the deficit by $90 billion over the next 
		decade.&nbsp; By the way, that $90 billion represents about one-eighth of the 
		amount these banks will pay out in bonuses over the same time period in 
		time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, finally, the fourth 
		component in improving our fiscal health is the bipartisan Fiscal 
		Commission that I’ve established that will provide a specific set of 
		solutions by the fall to deal with our medium- and long-term deficit.&nbsp; 
		And I have to warn you this will not be easy.&nbsp; I know that some like to 
		make the argument that if we would just eliminate pork barrel projects 
		and foreign aid, we could eliminate our deficit.&nbsp; Turns out such 
		spending makes up just 3 percent of our deficit.&nbsp; You combine all 
		foreign aid and all earmarks -- that’s 3 percent of our budget.&nbsp; So 
		meeting the deficit challenge will require some very difficult decisions 
		about the largely popular programs that make up the other 97 percent.&nbsp; 
		It means we’ll have to sort through our priorities and figure out what 
		programs that we can do without.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On this point, I strongly 
		agree with my friends in the other party.&nbsp; What I don’t agree with is 
		the notion that we should also sacrifice critical investments in our 
		people and our future.&nbsp; You know, if you’re a family who’s tightening 
		your belt, you will definitely sacrifice going out to dinner, but you’re 
		not going to sacrifice saving for your child’s college education.&nbsp; It’s 
		precisely our investments in education and innovation that will make 
		America more competitive in the 21st century.&nbsp; And we can’t go back; 
		we’ve got to move forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why I’ve made 
		education reform a top priority -- because countries that out-educate us 
		today will out-compete us tomorrow.&nbsp; And so we want every citizen to 
		have the skills and training they need in a global economy -- from the 
		day that you’re born through whatever career you may choose.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last year, we launched a 
		national competition to improve our schools based on a simple idea:&nbsp; 
		Instead of funding the status quo, we will only invest in reform -- 
		reform that raises student achievement, that inspires students to excel 
		in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the 
		future of too many young Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And to achieve my goal of 
		ensuring America once more has the highest proportion of college 
		graduates in the world by 2020, we passed a law that will make college 
		more affordable by ending the unnecessary taxpayer subsidies that go to 
		financial institutions for student loans.&nbsp; That means we’re saving 
		billions of dollars that will go directly to students, including 
		students right here at Carnegie Mellon.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s a bill that will also 
		revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the 
		children of so many working families.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition to training our 
		workers for the jobs of the future, we’re also investing in the 
		innovation that will create those jobs here in America -- the research, 
		the technology, the infrastructure that will secure our economic 
		future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Right now, as we speak, the 
		Recovery Act is putting Americans to work building a 21st century 
		America.&nbsp; There’s no reason China should have the fastest trains or that 
		rural Pennsylvania should be without high-speed Internet access.&nbsp; We’ve 
		got to make those investments.&nbsp; From the first railroads to the 
		Interstate Highway System, this nation has always been built to 
		compete.&nbsp; So we’re going to invest, and are investing right now, in new 
		infrastructure -- expanding broadband, health information technology, 
		advanced manufacturing facilities, America’s first high-speed rail 
		network.&nbsp; We’re also investing in the ideas and technologies that will 
		lead to new jobs and entire new industries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Consider what we’ve done 
		with clean energy.&nbsp; The tax credits and loan guarantees in the Recovery 
		Act alone will lead to 720,000 clean energy jobs in America by 2012 -- 
		720,000.&nbsp; I’ll give you one example.&nbsp; The United States 
		used to make less than 2 percent of the world’s advanced batteries for 
		hybrid cars.&nbsp; By 2015, because of the investments that we made, we’ll 
		have enough capacity to make up to 40 percent of these batteries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this brings me to an 
		issue that’s on everybody’s minds right now -- namely, what kind of 
		energy future can ensure our long-term prosperity.&nbsp; The catastrophe 
		unfolding in the Gulf right now may prove to be a result of human error, 
		or of corporations taking dangerous shortcuts to compromise safety, or a 
		combination of both.&nbsp; And I’ve launched a National Commission so that 
		the American people will have answers on exactly what happened.&nbsp; But we 
		have to acknowledge that there are inherent risks to drilling four miles 
		beneath the surface of the Earth, and these are risks -- these are risks that are bound to increase the harder oil extraction 
		becomes.&nbsp; We also have to acknowledge that an America run solely on 
		fossil fuels should not be the vision we have for our children and our 
		grandchildren.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We consume more than 20 
		percent of the world’s oil, but have less than 2 percent of the world’s 
		oil reserves.&nbsp; So without a major change in our energy policy, our 
		dependence on oil means that we will continue to send billions of 
		dollars of our hard-earned wealth to other countries every month -- 
		including countries in dangerous and unstable regions.&nbsp; In other words, 
		our continued dependence on fossil fuels will jeopardize our national 
		security.&nbsp; It will smother our planet.&nbsp; And it will continue to put our 
		economy and our environment at risk.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I understand that we 
		can’t end our dependence on fossil fuels overnight.&nbsp; That’s why I 
		supported a careful plan of offshore oil production as one part of our 
		overall energy strategy.&nbsp; But we can pursue such production only if it’s 
		safe, and only if it’s used as a short-term solution while we transition 
		to a clean energy economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the time has come to 
		aggressively accelerate that transition.&nbsp; The time has come, once and 
		for all, for this nation to fully embrace a clean energy future.&nbsp; 
		Now, that means continuing our unprecedented effort to make 
		everything from our homes and businesses to our cars and trucks more 
		energy-efficient.&nbsp; It means tapping into our natural gas reserves, and 
		moving ahead with our plan to expand our nation’s fleet of nuclear power 
		plants.&nbsp; It means rolling back billions of dollars of tax breaks to oil 
		companies so we can prioritize investments in clean energy research and 
		development.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the only way the 
		transition to clean energy will ultimately succeed is if the private 
		sector is fully invested in this future -- if capital comes off the 
		sidelines and the ingenuity of our entrepreneurs is unleashed.&nbsp; And the 
		only way to do that is by finally putting a price on carbon 
		pollution.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, many businesses have 
		already embraced this idea because it provides a level of certainty 
		about the future.&nbsp; And for those that face transition costs, we can help 
		them adjust.&nbsp; But if we refuse to take into account the full costs of 
		our fossil fuel addiction -- if we don’t factor in the environmental 
		costs and the national security costs and the true economic costs -- we 
		will have missed our best chance to seize a clean energy future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The House of Representatives 
		has already passed a comprehensive energy and climate bill, and there is 
		currently a plan in the Senate -- a plan that was developed with ideas 
		from Democrats and Republicans -- that would achieve the same goal.&nbsp; 
		And, Pittsburgh, I want you to know, the votes may not be there right 
		now, but I intend to find them in the coming months.&nbsp;I 
		will continue to make the case for a clean energy future wherever and 
		whenever I can.&nbsp; I will work with anyone to get this done 
		-- and we will get it done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The next generation will not 
		be held hostage to energy sources from the last century.&nbsp; We are not 
		going to move backwards.&nbsp; We are going to move forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This overarching principle 
		-- that we must invest in and embrace the innovation and technology of 
		the future and not the past -- that applies beyond our energy policy.&nbsp; 
		That’s why we’ve decided to devote more than 3 percent of our GDP to 
		research and development -- to spur the discovery of services and 
		products and businesses that we have yet to imagine.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ve proposed making the 
		research and experimentation tax credit permanent -- a tax credit that 
		helps businesses afford the high costs of developing new technologies 
		and new products.&nbsp; Last year, we made the largest investment in basic 
		research funding in history.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The possibilities of where 
		this research might lead are endless.&nbsp; Imagine a new treatment that 
		kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched; regenerative 
		medicine that ends the agonizing wait for an organ transplant.&nbsp; Imagine 
		a lightweight vest for soldiers and police officers that can stop 
		armor-piercing bullets; educational software that’s as effective and 
		engaging as a personal tutor; intelligent prosthetics that can enable a 
		wounded veteran to play the piano again.&nbsp; And now imagine all the 
		workers and small business owners and consumers who would benefit from 
		these discoveries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can’t know for certain 
		what the future will bring.&nbsp; We can’t guess with 100 percent accuracy 
		what industries and innovations will next shape our world.&nbsp; I’m sure 
		there were times when this city couldn’t imagine life without steel 
		mills and heavy smog that filled these streets.&nbsp; And when that industry 
		shrank and so many jobs were lost, who could have guessed that 
		Pittsburgh would fare better than many other Rust Belt cities, and 
		reemerge as a center for technology and green jobs, health care, and 
		education?&nbsp; Who would have thought that the University of Pittsburgh 
		Medical Center’s logo would one day adorn the U.S. Steel Tower, or that 
		this institute -- Carnegie Mellon -- would be the region’s largest 
		employer?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of this came to be 
		because as a community, you prepared and adapted and invested in a 
		better future -- even if you weren’t always sure what that future would 
		look like.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s what America 
		does.&nbsp; That’s what we’ve always done.&nbsp; The interests of the status quo 
		will always have the most vocal and powerful defenders at every level of 
		government.&nbsp; There will always be lobbyists for the banks or the 
		insurance industry that doesn’t want more regulation; or the corporation 
		that would prefer to see more tax breaks instead of more investments in 
		infrastructure or education.&nbsp; And let’s face it -- a lot of us find the 
		prospect of change scary, even when we know the status quo isn’t working 
		for us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there’s no natural lobby 
		for the clean energy company that may start a few years from now.&nbsp; 
		There’s no natural lobby for the research that may lead to a lifesaving 
		medical breakthrough.&nbsp; There’s no natural lobby for the student who may 
		not be able to afford a college education, but if they got one could end 
		up making discoveries that would transform America and the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s our job as a nation to 
		advocate on behalf of the America that we hope for -- to make decisions 
		that will benefit the next generation -- even if it’s not always 
		popular; even if we can’t always see those benefits in the short-term.&nbsp; 
		We make decisions like this on behalf of our own children every single 
		day.&nbsp; And while it’s harder to do with an entire country as large and 
		diverse as ours, it’s no less important.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The role of government has 
		never been to plan every detail or dictate every outcome.&nbsp; At its best, 
		government has simply knocked away barriers to opportunity and laid the 
		foundation for a better future.&nbsp; Our people -- with all their drive and 
		ingenuity -- always end up building the rest.&nbsp; And if we can do that 
		again -- if we can continue building that foundation and making those 
		hard decisions on behalf of the next generation -- I have no doubt that 
		we will leave our children the America that we all hope for.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, everybody.&nbsp; God 
		bless you.&nbsp; God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
