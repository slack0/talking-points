		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rosy, thank you for your 
		kind words.&nbsp; I have never seen Rosy on the basketball court.&nbsp; I'll bet 
		it would be a treat.&nbsp; Rosy, you've been a dear friend of mine for a 
		long time and a tireless advocate for the unbreakable bonds between 
		Israel and the United States.&nbsp; And as you complete your term as 
		President, I salute your leadership and your commitment.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank the board 
		of directors.&nbsp; As always, I知 glad to see my long-time friends in the 
		Chicago delegation.&nbsp; I also want to thank the members of Congress who 
		are with us here today, and who will be speaking to you over the next

		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I知 glad that my 
		outstanding young Ambassador to Israel, 
		<a href="http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Dan_Shapiro">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dan Shapiro</font></a>, is in the house.&nbsp; I

		pleased that we池e joined by so many Israeli officials, including 
		<a href="http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Michael_Oren">

		<font color="#0000FF">AIPAC</font></a>, I知 especially impressed to see so many young people here.&nbsp; You 
		don't yet get the front seats -- I understand.&nbsp; You have to earn that. 
		But students from all over the country who are making their voices heard 
		and engaging deeply in our democratic debate.&nbsp; You carry with you an 
		extraordinary legacy of more than six decades of friendship between the 
		United States and Israel.&nbsp; And you have the opportunity -- and the 
		responsibility -- to make your own mark on the world.&nbsp; And for 
		inspiration, you can look to the man who preceded me on this stage, 
		who's being honored at this conference -- my friend, 
		<a href="http://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Shimon_Peres">
		<font color="#0000FF">President Shimon 
		Peres</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shimon was born a world 
		away from here, in a 
		<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Shtetl">
		<font color="#0000FF">shtetl</font></a> in what was then Poland, a few years after 
		the end of the first world war.&nbsp; But his heart was always in Israel, the 
		historic homeland of the Jewish people.&nbsp; And when he was just a boy he 
		made his journey across land and sea -- toward home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In his life, he has fought 
		for Israel痴 independence, and he has fought for peace and security.&nbsp; As 
		a member of the 
		<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Haganah">
		<font color="#0000FF">Haganah</font></a> and a member of the 
		<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Knesset">
		<font color="#0000FF">Knesset</font></a>, as a Minister of 
		Defense and Foreign Affairs, as a Prime Minister and as President -- 
		Shimon helped build the nation that thrives today:&nbsp; the Jewish state of 
		Israel.&nbsp; But beyond these extraordinary achievements, he has also 
		been a powerful moral voice that reminds us that right makes might -- 
		not the other way around.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shimon once described the 
		story of the Jewish people by saying it proved that, &quot;slings, arrows and 
		gas chambers can annihilate man, but cannot destroy human values, 
		dignity, and freedom.&quot;&nbsp; And he has lived those values.&nbsp; He has taught us 
		to ask more of ourselves, and to empathize more with our fellow human 
		beings.&nbsp; I am grateful for his life's work and his moral example.&nbsp; And 
		I'm proud to announce that later this spring, I will invite Shimon Peres 
		to the White House to present him with America痴 highest civilian honor 
		-- the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom">
		<font color="#0000FF">Presidential Medal of Freedom</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In many ways, this award 
		is a symbol of the broader ties that bind our nations.&nbsp; The United 
		States and Israel share interests, but we also share those human values 
		that Shimon spoke about:&nbsp; A commitment to human dignity.&nbsp; A belief that 
		freedom is a right that is given to all of God's children.&nbsp; An 
		experience that shows us that democracy is the one and only form of 
		government that can truly respond to the aspirations of citizens.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America痴 Founding Fathers 
		understood this truth, just as Israel痴 founding generation did.&nbsp; 
		President Truman put it well, describing his decision to formally 
		recognize Israel only minutes after it declared independence.&nbsp; He said, 
		</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">I had faith in Israel before it was established.&nbsp; I believe it has a 
		glorious future before it -- as not just another sovereign nation, but 
		as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For over six decades, the 
		American people have kept that faith.&nbsp; Yes, we are bound to Israel 
		because of the interests that we share -- in security for our 
		communities, prosperity for our people, the new frontiers of science 
		that can light the world. But ultimately it is our common ideals that 
		provide the true foundation for our relationship.&nbsp; That is why America痴 
		commitment to Israel has endured under Democratic and Republican 
		Presidents, and congressional leaders of both parties.&nbsp; In the United 
		States, our support for Israel is bipartisan, and that is how it should 
		stay.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">AIPAC痴 work continually 
		nurtures this bond.&nbsp; And because of AIPAC痴 effectiveness in carrying 
		out its mission, you can expect that over the next several days, you 
		will hear many fine words from elected officials describing their 
		commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship.&nbsp; But as you examine my 
		commitment, you don稚 just have to count on my words.&nbsp; You can look at 
		my deeds.&nbsp; Because over the last three years, as President of the United 
		States, I have kept my commitments to the state of Israel.&nbsp; At every 
		crucial juncture -- at every fork in the road -- we have been there for 
		Israel.&nbsp; Every single time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Four years ago, I stood 
		before you and said that, &quot;Israel痴 security is sacrosanct.&nbsp; It is 
		non-negotiable.&quot;&nbsp; That belief has guided my actions as President.&nbsp; The 
		fact is, my administration痴 commitment to Israel痴 security has been 
		unprecedented.&nbsp; Our military and intelligence cooperation has never been 
		closer.&nbsp; Our joint exercises and training have never been more robust.&nbsp; 
		Despite a tough budget environment, our security assistance has 
		increased every single year.&nbsp; We are investing in new capabilities.&nbsp; 
		We池e providing Israel with more advanced technology -- the types of 
		products and systems that only go to our closest friends and allies.&nbsp; 
		And make no mistake: We will do what it takes to preserve Israel痴 
		qualitative military edge -- because Israel must always have the ability 
		to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This isn稚 just about 
		numbers on a balance sheet.&nbsp; As a senator, I spoke to Israeli troops on 
		the Lebanese border.&nbsp; I visited with families who致e known the terror of 
		<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sderot#Rocket_fire_from_Gaza">
		<font color="#0000FF">rocket fire in Sderot</font></a>.&nbsp; And that痴 why, as President, I have provided 
		critical funding to deploy the Iron Dome system that has intercepted 
		rockets that might have hit homes and hospitals and schools in that town 
		and in others.&nbsp; Now our assistance is expanding Israel痴 defensive 
		capabilities, so that more Israelis can live free from the fear of 
		rockets and ballistic missiles.&nbsp; Because no family, no citizen, should 
		live in fear.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And just as we致e been 
		there with our security assistance, we've been there through our 
		diplomacy.&nbsp; When the <a href="http://www.goldstonereport.org/">
		<font color="#0000FF">Goldstone report</font></a> unfairly singled out Israel for 
		criticism, we challenged it.&nbsp; When Israel was isolated in the aftermath 
		of the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid">
		<font color="#0000FF">flotilla incident</font></a>, we supported them.&nbsp; When the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban_Review_Conference">
		<font color="#0000FF">Durban conference</font></a> 
		was commemorated, we boycotted it, and we will always reject the notion 
		that Zionism is racism.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When one-sided resolutions 
		are brought up at the Human Rights Council, we oppose them.&nbsp; When 
		Israeli diplomats feared for their lives in Cairo, we intervened to save 
		them.&nbsp; When there are efforts to boycott or divest from Israel, we will 
		stand against them.&nbsp;And whenever an effort is made to de-legitimize the 
		state of Israel, my administration has opposed them.&nbsp; So there should 
		not be a shred of doubt by now -- when the chips are down, I have 
		Israel痴 back.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Which is why, if during 
		this political season -- you hear some questions regarding my 
		administration痴 support for Israel, remember that it痴 not backed up by 
		the facts.&nbsp; And remember that the U.S.-Israel relationship is simply too 
		important to be distorted by partisan politics.&nbsp; America痴 national 
		security is too important.&nbsp; Israel痴 security is too important.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, there are those 
		who question not my security and diplomatic commitments, but rather my 
		administration痴 ongoing pursuit of peace between Israelis and 
		Palestinians.&nbsp; So let me say this:&nbsp; I make no apologies for pursuing 
		peace.&nbsp; Israel痴 own leaders understand the necessity of peace.&nbsp; Prime 
		Minister Netanyahu, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak">
		<font color="#0000FF">Defense Minister Barak</font></a>, President Peres -- each of 
		them have called for two states, a secure Israel that lives side by side 
		with an independent Palestinian state.&nbsp; I believe that peace is 
		profoundly in Israel痴 security interest.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The reality that Israel 
		faces -- from shifting demographics, to emerging technologies, to an 
		extremely difficult international environment -- demands a resolution of 
		this issue.&nbsp; And I believe that peace with the Palestinians is 
		consistent with Israel痴 founding values -- because of our shared belief 
		in self-determination, and because Israel痴 place as a Jewish and 
		democratic state must be protected.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, peace is hard 
		to achieve.&nbsp; There痴 a reason why it's remained elusive for six 
		decades.&nbsp; The upheaval and uncertainty in Israel痴 neighborhood makes it 
		that much harder -- from the horrific violence raging in Syria, to the 
		transition in Egypt.&nbsp; And the division within the Palestinian leadership 
		makes it harder still -- most notably, with Hamas痴 continued rejection 
		of Israel痴 very right to exist.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But as hard as it may be, 
		we should not, and cannot, give in to cynicism or despair.&nbsp; The changes 
		taking place in the region make peace more important, not less.&nbsp; And 
		I've made it clear that there will be no lasting peace unless Israel痴 
		security concerns are met.&nbsp; That's why we continue to press Arab leaders 
		to reach out to Israel, and will continue to support the peace treaty 
		with Egypt.&nbsp; That痴 why -- just as we encourage Israel to be resolute in 
		the pursuit of peace -- we have continued to insist that any Palestinian 
		partner must recognize Israel痴 right to exist, and reject violence, and 
		adhere to existing agreements.&nbsp; And that is why my administration has 
		consistently rejected any efforts to short-cut negotiations or impose an 
		agreement on the parties.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Rosy noted, last year, 
		I stood before you and pledged that, &quot;the United States will stand up 
		against efforts to single Israel out at the United Nations.&quot;&nbsp; As you 
		know, that pledge has been kept.&nbsp; 
		<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamaungeneralassembly.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">Last September, I stood before the 
		United Nations General Assembly</font></a> and reaffirmed that any lasting peace 
		must acknowledge the fundamental legitimacy of Israel and its security 
		concerns.&nbsp; I said that America痴 commitment to Israel痴 security is 
		unshakeable, our friendship with Israel is enduring, and that Israel 
		must be recognized.&nbsp; No American President has made such a clear 
		statement about our support for Israel at the United Nations at such a 
		difficult time.&nbsp; People usually give those speeches before audiences 
		like this one -- not before the General Assembly.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I must say, there was 
		not a lot of applause.&nbsp; But it was the right thing to do.&nbsp; And as a 
		result, today there is no doubt -- anywhere in the world -- that the 
		United States will insist upon Israel痴 security and legitimacy.&nbsp; That 
		will be true as we continue our efforts to pursue -- in the pursuit of 
		peace.&nbsp; And that will be true when it comes to the issue that is such a 
		focus for all of us today:&nbsp; Iran痴 nuclear program -- a threat that has 
		the potential to bring together the worst rhetoric about Israel痴 
		destruction with the world痴 most dangerous weapons.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let痴 begin with a basic 
		truth that you all understand:&nbsp; No Israeli government can tolerate a 
		nuclear weapon in the hands of a regime that denies the Holocaust, 
		threatens to wipe Israel off the map, and sponsors terrorist groups 
		committed to Israel痴 destruction.&nbsp; And so I understand the profound 
		historical obligation that weighs on the shoulders of Bibi Netanyahu and 
		Ehud Barak, and all of Israel痴 leaders.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A nuclear-armed Iran is 
		completely counter to Israel痴 security interests.&nbsp; But it is also 
		counter to the national security interests of the United States.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Indeed, the entire world 
		has an interest in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; A 
		nuclear-armed Iran would thoroughly undermine the non-proliferation 
		regime that we've done so much to build.&nbsp; There are risks that an 
		Iranian nuclear weapon could fall into the hands of a terrorist 
		organization.&nbsp; It is almost certain that others in the region would feel 
		compelled to get their own nuclear weapon, triggering an arms race in 
		one of the world's most volatile regions.&nbsp; It would embolden a regime 
		that has brutalized its own people, and it would embolden Iran痴 
		proxies, who have carried out terrorist attacks from the Levant to 
		southwest Asia.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that is why, four 
		years ago, I made a commitment to the American people, and said that we 
		would use all elements of American power to pressure Iran and prevent it 
		from acquiring a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; And that is what we have done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I took office, the 
		efforts to apply pressure on Iran were in tatters.&nbsp; Iran had gone from 
		zero centrifuges spinning to thousands, without facing broad pushback 
		from the world.&nbsp; In the region, Iran was ascendant -- increasingly 
		popular, and extending its reach.&nbsp; In other words, the Iranian 
		leadership was united and on the move, and the international community 
		was divided about how to go forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so from my very first 
		months in office, we put forward a very clear choice to the Iranian 
		regime:&nbsp; a path that would allow them to rejoin the community of nations 
		if they meet their international obligations, or a path that leads to an 
		escalating series of consequences if they don't.&nbsp; In fact, our policy of 
		engagement -- quickly rebuffed by the Iranian regime -- allowed us to 
		rally the international community as never before, to expose Iran痴 
		intransigence, and to apply pressure that goes far beyond anything that 
		the United States could do on our own.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because of our efforts, 
		Iran is under greater pressure than ever before.&nbsp; Some of you will 
		recall, people predicted that Russia and China wouldn稚 join us to move 
		toward pressure.&nbsp; They did.&nbsp; And in 2010 the U.N. Security Council 
		overwhelmingly supported a comprehensive sanctions effort.&nbsp; Few thought 
		that sanctions could have an immediate bite on the Iranian regime.&nbsp; They 
		have, slowing the Iranian nuclear program and virtually grinding the 
		Iranian economy to a halt in 2011.&nbsp; Many questioned whether we could 
		hold our coalition together as we moved against Iran痴 Central Bank and 
		oil exports.&nbsp; But our friends in Europe and Asia and elsewhere are 
		joining us.&nbsp; And in 2012, the Iranian government faces the prospect of 
		even more crippling sanctions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is where we are today 
		-- because of our work.&nbsp; Iran is isolated, its leadership divided and 
		under pressure.&nbsp; And by the way, the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring">
		<font color="#0000FF">Arab Spring</font></a> has only increased 
		these trends, as the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime is exposed, and its 
		ally -- the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad">
		<font color="#0000FF">Assad</font></a> regime -- is crumbling.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, so long as Iran 
		fails to meet its obligations, this problem remains unresolved.&nbsp; The 
		effective implementation of our policy is not enough -- we must 
		accomplish our objective.&nbsp; And in that effort, I firmly believe that an 
		opportunity still remains for diplomacy -- backed by pressure -- to 
		succeed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The United States and 
		Israel both assess that Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon, and we 
		are exceedingly vigilant in monitoring their program.&nbsp; Now, the 
		international community has a responsibility to use the time and space 
		that exists.&nbsp; Sanctions are continuing to increase, and this July -- 
		thanks to our diplomatic coordination -- a European ban on Iranian oil 
		imports will take hold.&nbsp; Faced with these increasingly dire 
		consequences, Iran痴 leaders still have the opportunity to make the 
		right decision.&nbsp; They can choose a path that brings them back into the 
		community of nations, or they can continue down a dead end.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And given their history, 
		there are, of course, no guarantees that the Iranian regime will make 
		the right choice.&nbsp; But both Israel and the United States have an 
		interest in seeing this challenge resolved diplomatically.&nbsp; After all, 
		the only way to truly solve this problem is for the Iranian government 
		to make a decision to forsake nuclear weapons.&nbsp; That痴 what history 
		tells us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, as President and 
		Commander-in-Chief, I have a deeply held preference for peace over war.&nbsp; 
		I have sent men and women into harm痴 way.&nbsp; I've seen the consequences 
		of those decisions in the eyes of those I meet who've come back gravely 
		wounded, and the absence of those who don稚 make it home. Long after I 
		leave this office, I will remember those moments as the most searing of 
		my presidency.&nbsp; And for this reason, as part of my solemn obligation to 
		the American people, I will only use force when the time and 
		circumstances demand it.&nbsp; And I know that Israeli leaders also know all 
		too well the costs and consequences of war, even as they recognize their 
		obligation to defend their country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We all prefer to resolve 
		this issue diplomatically.&nbsp; Having said that, Iran痴 leaders should have 
		no doubt about the resolve of the United States -- just as they should 
		not doubt Israel痴 sovereign right to make its own decisions about what 
		is required to meet its security needs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have said that when it 
		comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, I will take no 
		options off the table, and I mean what I say.&nbsp; That includes all 
		elements of American power:&nbsp; A political effort aimed at isolating Iran; 
		a diplomatic effort to sustain our coalition and ensure that the Iranian 
		program is monitored; an economic effort that imposes crippling 
		sanctions; and, yes, a military effort to be prepared for any 
		contingency.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Iran痴 leaders should 
		understand that I do not have a policy of containment; I have a policy 
		to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.&nbsp; And as I have made 
		clear time and again during the course of my presidency, I will not 
		hesitate to use force when it is necessary to defend the United States 
		and its interests.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moving forward, I would 
		ask that we all remember the weightiness of these issues; the stakes 
		involved for Israel, for America, and for the world.&nbsp; Already, there is 
		too much loose talk of war.&nbsp; Over the last few weeks, such talk has only 
		benefited the Iranian government, by driving up the price of oil, which 
		they depend on to fund their nuclear program.&nbsp; For the sake of Israel痴 
		security, America痴 security, and the peace and security of the world, 
		now is not the time for bluster.&nbsp; Now is the time to let our increased 
		pressure sink in, and to sustain the broad international coalition we 
		have built.&nbsp; Now is the time to heed the timeless advice from Teddy 
		Roosevelt:&nbsp; 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Stick_ideology">
		<font color="#0000FF">Speak softly; carry a big stick</font></a>.&nbsp;And as we do, rest assured 
		that the Iranian government will know our resolve, and that our 
		coordination with Israel will continue.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are challenging 
		times.&nbsp; But we've been through challenging times before, and the United 
		States and Israel have come through them together.&nbsp; Because of our 
		cooperation, citizens in both our countries have benefited from the 
		bonds that bring us together.&nbsp; I'm proud to be one of those people.&nbsp; In 
		the past, I've shared in this forum just why those bonds are so personal 
		for me:&nbsp; the stories of a great uncle who helped liberate Buchenwald, to 
		my memories of returning there with Elie Wiesel; from sharing books with 
		President Peres to sharing 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder">
		<font color="#0000FF">seders</font></a> with my young staff in a tradition 
		that started on the campaign trail and continues in the White House; 
		from the countless friends I know in this room to the concept of &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam"><font color="#0000FF">tikkun 
		olam</font></a>&quot; that has enriched and guided my life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Harry Truman 
		understood, Israel痴 story is one of hope. We may not agree on every 
		single issue -- no two nations do, and our democracies contain a vibrant 
		diversity of views.&nbsp; But we agree on the big things -- the things that 
		matter.&nbsp; And together, we are working to build a better world -- one 
		where our people can live free from fear; one where peace is founded 
		upon justice; one where our children can know a future that is more 
		hopeful than the present.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no shortage of 
		speeches on the friendship between the United States and Israel.&nbsp; But 
		I'm also mindful of the proverb, &quot;A man is judged by his deeds, not his 
		words.&quot;&nbsp; So if you want to know where my heart lies, look no further 
		than what I have done -- to stand up for Israel; to secure both of our 
		countries; and to see that the rough waters of our time lead to a 
		peaceful and prosperous shore.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, 
		everybody.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; God bless the people of Israel.&nbsp; God bless 
		the United States of America.</font></p>
