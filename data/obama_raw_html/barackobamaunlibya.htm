<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you for convening this meeting to 
		address a task that must be the work of all of us -- supporting the 
		people of Libya as they build a future that is free and democratic and 
		prosperous. And I want to thank President Jalil for his remarks and for 
		all that he and Prime Minister Jibril have done to help Libya reach this 
		moment.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To all the heads of state, 
		to all the countries represented here who have done so much over the 
		past several months to ensure this day could come, I want to say thank 
		you, as well.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, the Libyan people are 
		writing a new chapter in the life of their nation. After four decades of 
		darkness, they can walk the streets, free from a tyrant. They are making 
		their voices heard -- in new newspapers, and on radio and television, in 
		public squares and on personal blogs. They’re launching political 
		parties and civil groups to shape their own destiny and secure their 
		universal rights. And here at the United Nations, the new flag of a free 
		Libya now flies among the community of nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/libyaflagnew.png" width="260" height="136"></font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Make no mistake -- credit 
		for the liberation of Libya belongs to the people of Libya. It was 
		Libyan men and women -- and children -- who took to the streets in 
		peaceful protest, who faced down the tanks and endured the snipers’ 
		bullets. It was Libyan fighters, often outgunned and outnumbered, who 
		fought pitched battles, town-by-town, block-by-block. It was Libyan 
		activists -- in the underground, in chat rooms, in mosques -- who kept a 
		revolution alive, even after some of the world had given up hope.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was Libyan women and 
		girls who hung flags and smuggled weapons to the front. It was Libyans 
		from countries around the world, including my own, who rushed home to 
		help, even though they, too, risked brutality and death. It was Libyan 
		blood that was spilled and Libya’s sons and daughters who gave their 
		lives. And on that August day -- after all that sacrifice, after 42 long 
		years -- it was Libyans who pushed their dictator from power.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time, Libya is a 
		lesson in what the international community can achieve when we stand 
		together as one. I said at the beginning of this process, we cannot and 
		should not intervene every time there is an injustice in the world. Yet 
		it’s also true that there are times where the world could have and 
		should have summoned the will to prevent the killing of innocents on a 
		horrific scale. And we are forever haunted by the atrocities that we did 
		not prevent, and the lives that we did not save. But this time was 
		different. This time, we, through the United Nations, found the courage 
		and the collective will to act.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When the old regime 
		unleashed a campaign of terror, threatening to roll back the democratic 
		tide sweeping the region, we acted as united nations, and we acted 
		swiftly -- broadening sanctions, imposing an arms embargo. The United 
		States led the effort to pass a historic resolution at the Security 
		Council authorizing &quot;all necessary measures&quot; to protect the Libyan 
		people. And when the civilians of Benghazi were threatened with a 
		massacre, we exercised that authority. Our international coalition 
		stopped the regime in its tracks, and saved countless lives, and gave 
		the Libyan people the time and the space to prevail.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Important, too, is how this 
		effort succeeded -- thanks to the leadership and contributions of many 
		countries. The United States was proud to play a decisive role, 
		especially in the early days, and then in a supporting capacity. But 
		let’s remember that it was the Arab League that appealed for action. It 
		was the world’s most effective alliance, NATO, that’s led a military 
		coalition of nearly 20 nations. It’s our European allies -- especially 
		the United Kingdom and France and Denmark and Norway -- that conducted 
		the vast majority of air strikes protecting rebels on the ground. It was 
		Arab states who joined the coalition, as equal partners. And it’s been 
		the United Nations and neighboring countries -- including Tunisia and 
		Egypt -- that have cared for the Libyans in the urgent humanitarian 
		effort that continues today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is how the 
		international community should work in the 21st century -- more nations 
		bearing the responsibility and the costs of meeting global challenges. 
		In fact, this is the very purpose of this United Nations. So every 
		nation represented here today can take pride in the innocent lives we 
		saved and in helping Libyans reclaim their country. It was the right 
		thing to do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, even as we speak, 
		remnants of the old regime continue to fight. Difficult days are still 
		ahead. But one thing is clear -- the future of Libya is now in the hands 
		of the Libyan people. For just as it was Libyans who tore down the old 
		order, it will be Libyans who build their new nation. And we’ve come 
		here today to say to the people of Libya -- just as the world stood by 
		you in your struggle to be free, we will now stand with you in your 
		struggle to realize the peace and prosperity that freedom can bring.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this effort, you will 
		have a friend and partner in the United States of America. Today, I can 
		announce that our ambassador is on his way back to Tripoli. And this 
		week, the American flag that was lowered before our embassy was attacked 
		will be raised again, over a re-opened American embassy. We will work 
		closely with the new U.N. Support Mission in Libya and with the nations 
		here today to assist the Libyan people in the hard work ahead.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, and most immediately: 
		security. So long as the Libyan people are being threatened, the 
		NATO-led mission to protect them will continue. And those still holding 
		out must understand -- the old regime is over, and it is time to lay 
		down your arms and join the new Libya. As this happens, the world must 
		also support efforts to secure dangerous weapons -- conventional and 
		otherwise -- and bring fighters under central, civilian control. For 
		without security, democracy and trade and investment cannot flourish.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second: the humanitarian 
		effort. The Transitional National Council has been working quickly to 
		restore water and electricity and food supplies to Tripoli. But for many 
		Libyans, each day is still a struggle -- to recover from their wounds, 
		reunite with their families, and return to their homes. And even after 
		the guns of war fall silent, the ravages of war will continue. So our 
		efforts to assist its victims must continue. In this, the United States 
		-- the United Nations will play a key role. And along with our partners, 
		the United States will do our part to help the hungry and the wounded.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third: a democratic 
		transition that is peaceful, inclusive and just. President Jalil has 
		just reaffirmed the Transitional National Council’s commitment to these 
		principles, and the United Nations will play a central role in 
		coordinating international support for this effort. We all know what is 
		needed -- a transition that is timely, new laws and a constitution that 
		uphold the rule of law, political parties and a strong civil society, 
		and, for the first time in Libyan history, free and fair elections.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">True democracy, however, 
		must flow from its citizens. So as Libyans rightly seek justice for past 
		crimes, let it be done in a spirit of reconciliation, and not reprisals 
		and violence. As Libyans draw strength from their faith -- a religion 
		rooted in peace and tolerance -- let there be a rejection of violent 
		extremism, which offers nothing but death and destruction. As Libyans 
		rebuild, let those efforts tap the experience of all those with the 
		skills to contribute, including the many Africans in Libya. And as 
		Libyans forge a society that is truly just, let it enshrine the rights 
		and role of women at all levels of society. For we know that the nations 
		that uphold the human rights of all people, especially their women, are 
		ultimately more successful and more prosperous.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Which brings me to the final 
		area where the world must stand with Libya, and that is restoring 
		prosperity. For too long, Libya’s vast riches were stolen and 
		squandered. Now that wealth must serve its rightful owners -- the Libyan 
		people. As sanctions are lifted, as the United States and the 
		international community unfreeze more Libyan assets, and as the 
		country's oil production is restored, the Libyan people deserve a 
		government that is transparent and accountable. And bound by the Libyan 
		students and entrepreneurs who have forged friendships in the United 
		States, we intend to build new partnerships to help unleash Libya’s 
		extraordinary potential.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, none of this will be 
		easy. After decades of iron rule by one man, it will take time to build 
		the institutions needed for a democratic Libya. I’m sure there will be 
		days of frustration; there will be days when progress is slow; there 
		will be days when some begin to wish for the old order and its illusion 
		of stability. And some in the world may ask, can Libya succeed? But if 
		we have learned anything these many months, it is this: Don’t 
		underestimate the aspirations and the will of the Libyan people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I want to conclude by 
		speaking directly to the people of Libya. Your task may be new, the 
		journey ahead may be fraught with difficulty, but everything you need to 
		build your future already beats in the heart of your nation. It’s the 
		same courage you summoned on that first February day; the same 
		resilience that brought you back out the next day and the next, even as 
		you lost family and friends; and the same unshakeable determination with 
		which you liberated Benghazi, broke the siege of Misurata, and have 
		fought through the coastal plain and the western mountains.<br>
		It’s the same unwavering conviction that said, there’s no turning back; 
		our sons and daughters deserve to be free.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the days after Tripoli 
		fell, people rejoiced in the streets and pondered the role ahead, and 
		one of those Libyans said, “We have this chance now to do something good 
		for our country, a chance we have dreamed of for so long.” So, to the 
		Libyan people, this is your chance. And today the world is saying, with 
		one unmistakable voice, we will stand with you as you seize this moment 
		of promise, as you reach for the freedom, the dignity, and the 
		opportunity that you deserve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, congratulations. And 
		thank you very much.</font></p>
