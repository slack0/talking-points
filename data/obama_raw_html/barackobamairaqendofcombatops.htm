&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good evening.&nbsp; Tonight, I’d 
		like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in Iraq, the 
		ongoing security challenges we face, and the need to rebuild our nation 
		here at home.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know this historic moment 
		comes at a time of great uncertainty for many Americans.&nbsp; We’ve now been 
		through nearly a decade of war.&nbsp; We’ve endured a long and painful 
		recession.&nbsp; And sometimes in the midst of these storms, the future that 
		we’re trying to build for our nation -- a future of lasting peace and 
		long-term prosperity -- may seem beyond our reach.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But this milestone should 
		serve as a reminder to all Americans that the future is ours to shape if 
		we move forward with confidence and commitment.&nbsp; It should also serve as 
		a message to the world that the United States of America intends to 
		sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">From this desk, seven and a 
		half years ago, <a href="gwbushiraq31903.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">President Bush announced the beginning of military 
		operations in Iraq</font></a>.&nbsp; Much has changed since that night.&nbsp; A war to disarm 
		a state became a fight against an insurgency.&nbsp; Terrorism and sectarian 
		warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart.&nbsp;Thousands of Americans gave 
		their lives; tens of thousands have been wounded.&nbsp; Our relations abroad 
		were strained.&nbsp; Our unity at home was tested.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are the rough waters 
		encountered during the course of one of America’s longest wars.&nbsp; Yet 
		there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides.&nbsp; At every turn, 
		America’s men and women in uniform have served with courage and 
		resolve.&nbsp; As Commander-in-Chief, I am incredibly proud of their 
		service.&nbsp; And like all Americans, I’m awed by their sacrifice, and by 
		the sacrifices of their families.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Americans who have 
		served in Iraq completed every mission they were given.&nbsp; They defeated a 
		regime that had terrorized its people.&nbsp; Together with Iraqis and 
		coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own, our troops 
		fought block by block to help Iraq seize the chance for a better 
		future.&nbsp; They shifted tactics to protect the Iraqi people, trained Iraqi 
		Security Forces, and took out terrorist leaders.&nbsp; Because of our troops 
		and civilians -- and because of the resilience of the Iraqi people -- 
		Iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny, even though many 
		challenges remain.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So tonight, I am announcing 
		that the American combat mission in Iraq has ended.&nbsp; Operation Iraqi 
		Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for 
		the security of their country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This was my pledge to the 
		American people as a candidate for this office.&nbsp; Last February, I 
		announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of Iraq, while 
		redoubling our efforts to strengthen Iraq’s Security Forces and support 
		its government and people.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s what we’ve done.&nbsp; 
		We’ve removed nearly 100,000 U.S. troops from Iraq.&nbsp; We’ve closed or 
		transferred to the Iraqis hundreds of bases.&nbsp; And we have moved millions 
		of pieces of equipment out of Iraq.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This completes a transition 
		to Iraqi responsibility for their own security.&nbsp; U.S. troops pulled out 
		of Iraq’s cities last summer, and Iraqi forces have moved into the lead 
		with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens.&nbsp; Even 
		as Iraq continues to suffer terrorist attacks, security incidents have 
		been near the lowest on record since the war began.&nbsp; And Iraqi forces 
		have taken the fight to al Qaeda, removing much of its leadership in 
		Iraqi-led operations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This year also saw Iraq hold 
		credible elections that drew a strong turnout.&nbsp; A caretaker 
		administration is in place as Iraqis form a government based on the 
		results of that election.&nbsp; Tonight, I encourage Iraq’s leaders to move 
		forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that is 
		just, representative, and accountable to the Iraqi people.&nbsp; And when 
		that government is in place, there should be no doubt:&nbsp; The Iraqi people 
		will have a strong partner in the United States.&nbsp; Our combat mission is 
		ending, but our commitment to Iraq’s future is not.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Going forward, a 
		transitional force of U.S. troops will remain in Iraq with a different 
		mission:&nbsp; advising and assisting Iraq’s Security Forces, supporting 
		Iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions, and protecting our 
		civilians.&nbsp; Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all 
		U.S. troops will leave by the end of next year.&nbsp; As our military draws 
		down, our dedicated civilians -- diplomats, aid workers, and advisors -- 
		are moving into the lead to support Iraq as it strengthens its 
		government, resolves political disputes, resettles those displaced by 
		war, and builds ties with the region and the world.&nbsp; That’s a message 
		that Vice President Biden is delivering to the Iraqi people through his 
		visit there today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This new approach reflects 
		our long-term partnership with Iraq -- one based upon mutual interest 
		and mutual respect.&nbsp; Of course, violence will not end with our combat 
		mission.&nbsp; Extremists will continue to set off bombs, attack Iraqi 
		civilians and try to spark sectarian strife.&nbsp; But ultimately, these 
		terrorists will fail to achieve their goals.&nbsp; Iraqis are a proud 
		people.&nbsp; They have rejected sectarian war, and they have no interest in 
		endless destruction.&nbsp; They understand that, in the end, only Iraqis can 
		resolve their differences and police their streets.&nbsp; Only Iraqis can 
		build a democracy within their borders.&nbsp; What America can do, and will 
		do, is provide support for the Iraqi people as both a friend and a 
		partner.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ending this war is not only 
		in Iraq’s interest -- it’s in our own.&nbsp; The United States has paid a 
		huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people.&nbsp; We 
		have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, 
		and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home.&nbsp; 
		We’ve persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people -- a 
		belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in 
		this cradle of civilization.&nbsp; Through this remarkable chapter in the 
		history of the United States and Iraq, we have met our responsibility.&nbsp; 
		Now, it’s time to turn the page.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we do, I’m mindful that 
		the Iraq war has been a contentious issue at home.&nbsp; Here, too, it’s time 
		to turn the page.&nbsp; This afternoon, I spoke to former President George W. 
		Bush.&nbsp; It’s well known that he and I disagreed about the war from its 
		outset.&nbsp; Yet no one can doubt President Bush’s support for our troops, 
		or his love of country and commitment to our security.&nbsp; As I’ve said, 
		there were patriots who supported this war, and patriots who opposed 
		it.&nbsp; And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and 
		women, and our hopes for Iraqis’ future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The greatness of our 
		democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences, and 
		to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead.&nbsp; 
		And no challenge is more essential to our security than our fight 
		against al Qaeda.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Americans across the 
		political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked 
		us on 9/11.&nbsp; Now, as we approach our 10th year of combat in Afghanistan, 
		there are those who are understandably asking tough questions about our 
		mission there.&nbsp; But we must never lose sight of what’s at stake.&nbsp; As we 
		speak, al Qaeda continues to plot against us, and its leadership remains 
		anchored in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.&nbsp; We will 
		disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda, while preventing Afghanistan 
		from again serving as a base for terrorists.&nbsp; And because of our 
		drawdown in Iraq, we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go 
		on offense.&nbsp; In fact, over the last 19 months, nearly a dozen al Qaeda 
		leaders -- and hundreds of al Qaeda’s extremist allies -- have been 
		killed or captured around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Within Afghanistan, I’ve 
		ordered the deployment of additional troops who -- under the command of 
		General David Petraeus -- are fighting to break the Taliban’s momentum.&nbsp;As with the surge in Iraq, these forces will be in place for a limited 
		time to provide space for the Afghans to build their capacity and secure 
		their own future.&nbsp; But, as was the case in Iraq, we can’t do for Afghans 
		what they must ultimately do for themselves.&nbsp; That’s why we’re training 
		Afghan Security Forces and supporting a political resolution to 
		Afghanistan’s problems.&nbsp; And next August, we will begin a transition to 
		Afghan responsibility.&nbsp; The pace of our troop reductions will be 
		determined by conditions on the ground, and our support for Afghanistan 
		will endure.&nbsp; But make no mistake:&nbsp; This transition will begin -- 
		because open-ended war serves neither our interests nor the Afghan 
		people’s.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Indeed, one of the lessons 
		of our effort in Iraq is that American influence around the world is not 
		a function of military force alone.&nbsp; We must use all elements of our 
		power -- including our diplomacy, our economic strength, and the power 
		of America’s example -- to secure our interests and stand by our 
		allies.&nbsp; And we must project a vision of the future that’s based not 
		just on our fears, but also on our hopes -- a vision that recognizes the 
		real dangers that exist around the world, but also the limitless 
		possibilities of our time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, old adversaries are 
		at peace, and emerging democracies are potential partners.&nbsp; New markets 
		for our goods stretch from Asia to the Americas.&nbsp; A new push for peace 
		in the Middle East will begin here tomorrow.&nbsp; Billions of young people 
		want to move beyond the shackles of poverty and conflict.&nbsp; As the leader 
		of the free world, America will do more than just defeat on the 
		battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction -- we will also lead 
		among those who are willing to work together to expand freedom and 
		opportunity for all people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, that effort must begin 
		within our own borders.&nbsp; Throughout our history, America has been 
		willing to bear the burden of promoting liberty and human dignity 
		overseas, understanding its links to our own liberty and security.&nbsp; But 
		we have also understood that our nation’s strength and influence abroad 
		must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home.&nbsp; And the bedrock of 
		that prosperity must be a growing middle class.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, over the last 
		decade, we’ve not done what’s necessary to shore up the foundations of 
		our own prosperity.&nbsp; We spent a trillion dollars at war, often financed 
		by borrowing from overseas.&nbsp; This, in turn, has short-changed 
		investments in our own people, and contributed to record deficits.&nbsp; For 
		too long, we have put off tough decisions on everything from our 
		manufacturing base to our energy policy to education reform.&nbsp; As a 
		result, too many middle-class families find themselves working harder 
		for less, while our nation’s long-term competitiveness is put at risk.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so at this moment, as we 
		wind down the war in Iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home with 
		as much energy, and grit, and sense of common purpose as our men and 
		women in uniform who have served abroad.&nbsp; They have met every test that 
		they faced.&nbsp; Now, it’s our turn.&nbsp; Now, it’s our responsibility to honor 
		them by coming together, all of us, and working to secure the dream that 
		so many generations have fought for -- the dream that a better life 
		awaits anyone who is willing to work for it and reach for it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our most urgent task is to 
		restore our economy, and put the millions of Americans who have lost 
		their jobs back to work.&nbsp; To strengthen our middle class, we must give 
		all our children the education they deserve, and all our workers the 
		skills that they need to compete in a global economy.&nbsp; We must jumpstart 
		industries that create jobs, and end our dependence on foreign oil.&nbsp; We 
		must unleash the innovation that allows new products to roll off our 
		assembly lines, and nurture the ideas that spring from our 
		entrepreneurs.&nbsp; This will be difficult.&nbsp; But in the days to come, it 
		must be our central mission as a people, and my central responsibility 
		as President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Part of that responsibility 
		is making sure that we honor our commitments to those who have served 
		our country with such valor.&nbsp; As long as I am President, we will 
		maintain the finest fighting force that the world has ever known, and we 
		will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as they have 
		served us.&nbsp; This is a sacred trust.&nbsp; That’s why we’ve already made one 
		of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades.&nbsp; We’re 
		treating the signature wounds of today’s wars -- post-traumatic stress 
		disorder and traumatic brain injury -- while providing the health care 
		and benefits that all of our veterans have earned.&nbsp; And we’re funding a 
		Post-9/11 GI Bill that helps our veterans and their families pursue the 
		dream of a college education.&nbsp; Just as the GI Bill helped those who 
		fought World War II -- including my grandfather -- become the backbone 
		of our middle class, so today’s servicemen and women must have the 
		chance to apply their gifts to expand the American economy.&nbsp; Because 
		part of ending a war responsibly is standing by those who have fought 
		it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Two weeks ago, America’s 
		final combat brigade in Iraq -- the Army’s Fourth Stryker Brigade -- 
		journeyed home in the pre-dawn darkness.&nbsp; Thousands of soldiers and 
		hundreds of vehicles made the trip from Baghdad, the last of them 
		passing into Kuwait in the early morning hours.&nbsp; Over seven years 
		before, American troops and coalition partners had fought their way 
		across similar highways, but this time no shots were fired.&nbsp; It was just 
		a convoy of brave Americans, making their way home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, the soldiers left 
		much behind.&nbsp; Some were teenagers when the war began.&nbsp; Many have served 
		multiple tours of duty, far from families who bore a heroic burden of 
		their own, enduring the absence of a husband’s embrace or a mother’s 
		kiss.&nbsp; Most painfully, since the war began, 55 members of the Fourth 
		Stryker Brigade made the ultimate sacrifice -- part of over 4,400 
		Americans who have given their lives in Iraq.&nbsp; As one staff sergeant 
		said, “I know that to my brothers in arms who fought and died, this day 
		would probably mean a lot.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those Americans gave their 
		lives for the values that have lived in the hearts of our people for 
		over two centuries.&nbsp; Along with nearly 1.5 million Americans who have 
		served in Iraq, they fought in a faraway place for people they never 
		knew.&nbsp; They stared into the darkest of human creations -- war -- and 
		helped the Iraqi people seek the light of peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In an age without surrender 
		ceremonies, we must earn victory through the success of our partners and 
		the strength of our own nation.&nbsp; Every American who serves joins an 
		unbroken line of heroes that stretches from Lexington to Gettysburg; 
		from Iwo Jima to Inchon; from Khe Sanh to Kandahar -- Americans who have 
		fought to see that the lives of our children are better than our own.&nbsp; 
		Our troops are the steel in our ship of state.&nbsp; And though our nation 
		may be travelling through rough waters, they give us confidence that our 
		course is true, and that beyond the pre-dawn darkness, better days lie 
		ahead.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp; May God bless 
		you.&nbsp; And may God bless the United States of America, and all who serve 
		her.</font></p>
