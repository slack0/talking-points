<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good afternoon, 
		everybody.&nbsp; Congress has now approved a compromise to reduce the deficit 
		and avert a default that would have devastated our economy.&nbsp; It was a 
		long and contentious debate.&nbsp; And I want to thank the American people 
		for keeping up the pressure on their elected officials to put politics 
		aside and work together for the good of the country.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This compromise guarantees 
		more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction.&nbsp; It’s an important first 
		step to ensuring that as a nation we live within our means.&nbsp; Yet it also 
		allows us to keep making key investments in things like education and 
		research that lead to new jobs, and assures that we’re not cutting too 
		abruptly while the economy is still fragile.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is, however, just the 
		first step.&nbsp; This compromise requires that both parties work together on 
		a larger plan to cut the deficit, which is important for the long-term 
		health of our economy.&nbsp; And since you can’t close the deficit with just 
		spending cuts, we’ll need a balanced approach where everything is on the 
		table.&nbsp; Yes, that means making some adjustments to protect health care 
		programs like Medicare so they’re there for future generations.&nbsp; It also 
		means reforming our tax code so that the wealthiest Americans and 
		biggest corporations pay their fair share.&nbsp; And it means getting rid of 
		taxpayer subsidies to oil and gas companies, and tax loopholes that help 
		billionaires pay a lower tax rate than teachers and nurses.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ve said it before; I 
		will say it again:&nbsp; We can’t balance the budget on the backs of the very 
		people who have borne the biggest brunt of this recession.&nbsp; We can’t 
		make it tougher for young people to go to college, or ask seniors to pay 
		more for health care, or ask scientists to give up on promising medical 
		research because we couldn’t close a tax shelter for the most fortunate 
		among us.&nbsp; Everyone is going to have to chip in.&nbsp; It’s only fair.&nbsp; 
		That’s the principle I’ll be fighting for during the next phase of this 
		process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And in the coming months, 
		I’ll continue also to fight for what the American people care most 
		about:&nbsp; new jobs, higher wages and faster economic growth.&nbsp; While 
		Washington has been absorbed in this debate about deficits, people 
		across the country are asking what we can do to help the father looking 
		for work.&nbsp; What are we going to do for the single mom who’s seen her 
		hours cut back at the hospital?&nbsp; What are we going to do to make it 
		easier for businesses to put up that “now hiring” sign?&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s part of the reason 
		that people are so frustrated with what’s been going on in this town.&nbsp; 
		In the last few months, the economy has already had to absorb an 
		earthquake in Japan, the economic headwinds coming from Europe, the Arab 
		Spring and the [rise] in oil prices -- all of which have been very 
		challenging for the recovery.&nbsp; But these are things we couldn’t 
		control.&nbsp; Our economy didn’t need Washington to come along with a 
		manufactured crisis to make things worse.&nbsp; That was in our hands.&nbsp; It’s 
		pretty likely that the uncertainty surrounding the raising of the debt 
		ceiling -- for both businesses and consumers -- has been unsettling, and 
		just one more impediment to the full recovery that we need.&nbsp; And it was 
		something that we could have avoided entirely.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, voters may have chosen 
		divided government, but they sure didn’t vote for dysfunctional 
		government.&nbsp; They want us to solve problems.&nbsp; They want us to get this 
		economy growing and adding jobs.&nbsp; And while deficit reduction is part of 
		that agenda, it is not the whole agenda.&nbsp; Growing the economy isn’t just 
		about cutting spending; it’s not about rolling back regulations that 
		protect our air and our water and keep our people safe.&nbsp; That’s not how 
		we’re going to get past this recession.&nbsp; We’re going to have to do more 
		than that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why, when 
		Congress gets back from recess, I will urge them to immediately take 
		some steps -- bipartisan, common-sense steps -- that will make a 
		difference; that will create a climate where businesses can hire, where 
		folks have more money in their pockets to spend, where people who are 
		out of work can find good jobs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We need to begin by 
		extending tax cuts for middle-class families so that you have more money 
		in your paychecks next year.&nbsp; If you’ve got more money in your paycheck, 
		you’re more likely to spend it.&nbsp; And that means small businesses and 
		medium-sized businesses and large businesses will all have more 
		customers.&nbsp; That means they’ll be in a better position to hire.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And while we’re at it, we 
		need to make sure that millions of workers who are still pounding the 
		pavement looking for jobs to support their families are not denied 
		needed unemployment benefits.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Through patent reform, we 
		can cut the red tape that stops too many inventors and entrepreneurs 
		from quickly turning new ideas into thriving businesses -- which holds 
		our whole economy back.&nbsp; And I want Congress to pass a set of trade 
		deals -- deals we’ve already negotiated -- that would help displaced 
		workers looking for new jobs and would allow our businesses to sell more 
		products in countries in Asia and South America, products that are 
		stamped with the words “Made in America.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also need to give more 
		opportunities to all those construction workers out there who lost their 
		jobs when the housing boom went bust.&nbsp; We could put them to work right 
		now, by giving loans to private companies that want to repair our roads 
		and our bridges and our airports, rebuilding our infrastructure.&nbsp; We 
		have workers who need jobs and a country that needs rebuilding; an 
		infrastructure bank would help us put them together.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And while we’re on the 
		topic of infrastructure, there’s another stalemate in Congress right now 
		involving our aviation industry which has stalled airport construction 
		projects all around the country and put the jobs of tens of thousands of 
		construction workers and others at risk -– because of politics.&nbsp; It’s 
		another Washington-inflicted wound on America, and Congress needs to 
		break that impasse now –- hopefully before the Senate adjourns -– so 
		these folks can get back to work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So these are some things 
		that we could be doing right now.&nbsp; There’s no reason for Congress not to 
		send me those bills so I can sign them into law right away as soon as 
		they get back from recess.&nbsp; Both parties share power in Washington, and 
		both parties need to take responsibility for improving this economy.&nbsp; 
		It’s not a Democratic responsibility or a Republican responsibility; it 
		is our collective responsibility as Americans.&nbsp; And I’ll be discussing 
		additional ideas in the weeks ahead to help companies hire, invest and 
		expand.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, we’ve seen in the past 
		few days that Washington has the ability to focus when there’s a timer 
		ticking down, and when there’s a looming disaster.&nbsp; It shouldn’t take 
		the risk of default -– the risk of economic catastrophe -– to get folks 
		in this town to work together and do their jobs.&nbsp; Because there’s 
		already a quiet crisis going on in the lives of a lot of families, in a 
		lot of communities, all across the country.&nbsp; They’re looking for work, 
		and they have been for a while; or they’re making do with fewer hours or 
		fewer customers; or they’re just trying to make ends meet.&nbsp; That ought 
		to compel Washington to cooperate.&nbsp; That ought to compel Washington to 
		compromise, and it ought to compel Washington to act.&nbsp; That ought to be 
		enough to get all of us in this town to do the jobs we were sent here to 
		do.&nbsp; We’ve got to do everything in our power to grow this economy and 
		put America back to work.&nbsp; That’s what I intend to do, and I’m looking 
		forward to working with Congress to make it happen.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks very much, 
		everybody.</font></p>
