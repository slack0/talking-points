<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. President, Mr. 
		Secretary-General, my fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; It is a 
		great honor to address this Assembly for the second time, nearly two 
		years after my election as President of the United States.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know this is no ordinary 
		time for our people.&nbsp; Each of us comes here with our own problems and 
		priorities.&nbsp; But there are also challenges that we share in common as 
		leaders and as nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We meet within an 
		institution built from the rubble of war, designed to unite the world in 
		pursuit of peace.&nbsp; And we meet within a city that for centuries has 
		welcomed people from across the globe, demonstrating that individuals of 
		every color, faith and station can come together to pursue opportunity, 
		build a community, and live with the blessing of human liberty.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Outside the doors of this 
		hall, the blocks and neighborhoods of this great city tell the story of 
		a difficult decade.&nbsp; Nine years ago, the destruction of the World Trade 
		Center signaled a threat that respected no boundary of dignity or 
		decency.&nbsp; Two years ago this month, a financial crisis on Wall Street 
		devastated American families on Main Street.&nbsp; These separate challenges 
		have affected people around the globe.&nbsp; Men and women and children have 
		been murdered by extremists from Casablanca to London; from Jalalabad to 
		Jakarta.&nbsp; The global economy suffered an enormous blow during the 
		financial crisis, crippling markets and deferring the dreams of millions 
		on every continent.&nbsp; Underneath these challenges to our security and 
		prosperity lie deeper fears:&nbsp; that ancient hatreds and religious divides 
		are once again ascendant; that a world which has grown more 
		interconnected has somehow slipped beyond our control.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are some of the 
		challenges that my administration has confronted since we came into 
		office.&nbsp; And today, I’d like to talk to you about what we’ve done over 
		the last 20 months to meet these challenges; what our responsibility is 
		to pursue peace in the Middle East; and what kind of world we are trying 
		to build in this 21st century.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me begin with what we 
		have done.&nbsp; I have had no greater focus as President than rescuing our 
		economy from potential catastrophe.&nbsp; And in an age when prosperity is 
		shared, we could not do this alone.&nbsp; So America has joined with nations 
		around the world to spur growth, and the renewed demand that could 
		restart job creation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are reforming our system 
		of global finance, beginning with Wall Street reform here at home, so 
		that a crisis like this never happens again.&nbsp; And we made the G20 the 
		focal point for international coordination, because in a world where 
		prosperity is more diffuse, we must broaden our circle of cooperation to 
		include emerging economies -- economies from every corner of the globe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is much to show for 
		our efforts, even as there is much work to be done.&nbsp; The global economy 
		has been pulled back from the brink of a depression, and is growing once 
		more.&nbsp; We have resisted protectionism, and are exploring ways to expand 
		trade and commerce among nations.&nbsp; But we cannot -- and will not -- rest 
		until these seeds of progress grow into a broader prosperity, not only 
		for all Americans, but for peoples around the globe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for our common security, 
		America is waging a more effective fight against al Qaeda, while winding 
		down the war in Iraq.&nbsp; Since I took office, the United States has 
		removed nearly 100,000 troops from Iraq.&nbsp; We have done so responsibly, 
		as Iraqis have transitioned to lead responsibility for the security of 
		their country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are now focused on 
		building a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while keeping our 
		commitment to remove the rest of our troops by the end of next year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While drawing down in Iraq, 
		we have refocused on defeating al Qaeda and denying its affiliates a 
		safe haven.&nbsp; In Afghanistan, the United States and our allies are 
		pursuing a strategy to break the Taliban’s momentum and build the 
		capacity of Afghanistan’s government and security forces, so that a 
		transition to Afghan responsibility can begin next July.&nbsp; And from South 
		Asia to the Horn of Africa, we are moving toward a more targeted 
		approach -- one that strengthens our partners and dismantles terrorist 
		networks without deploying large American armies.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we pursue the world’s 
		most dangerous extremists, we’re also denying them the world’s most 
		dangerous weapons, and pursuing the peace and security of a world 
		without nuclear weapons.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Earlier this year, 47 
		nations embraced a work-plan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials 
		within four years.&nbsp; We have joined with Russia to sign the most 
		comprehensive arms control treaty in decades.&nbsp; We have reduced the role 
		of nuclear weapons in our security strategy.&nbsp; And here, at the United 
		Nations, we came together to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
		Treaty.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As part of our effort on 
		non-proliferation, I offered the Islamic Republic of Iran an extended 
		hand last year, and underscored that it has both rights and 
		responsibilities as a member of the international community.&nbsp; I also 
		said -- in this hall -- that Iran must be held accountable if it failed 
		to meet those responsibilities.&nbsp; And that is what we have done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Iran is the only party to 
		the NPT that cannot demonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear 
		program, and those actions have consequences.&nbsp; Through U.N. Security 
		Council Resolution 1929, we made it clear that international law is not 
		an empty promise.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now let me be clear once 
		more:&nbsp; The United States and the international community seek a 
		resolution to our differences with Iran, and the door remains open to 
		diplomacy should Iran choose to walk through it.&nbsp; But the Iranian 
		government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment and confirm 
		to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear program.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we combat the spread of 
		deadly weapons, we’re also confronting the specter of climate change.&nbsp; 
		After making historic investments in clean energy and efficiency at 
		home, we helped forge an accord in Copenhagen that -- for the first time 
		-- commits all major economies to reduce their emissions.&nbsp; We are keenly 
		aware this is just a first step.&nbsp; And going forward, we will support a 
		process in which all major economies meet our responsibilities to 
		protect the planet while unleashing the power of clean energy to serve 
		as an engine of growth and development.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America has also embraced 
		unique responsibilities with come -- that come with our power.&nbsp; Since 
		the rains came and the floodwaters rose in Pakistan, we have pledged our 
		assistance, and we should all support the Pakistani people as they 
		recover and rebuild.&nbsp; And when the earth shook and Haiti was devastated 
		by loss, we joined a coalition of nations in response.&nbsp; Today, we honor 
		those from the U.N. family who lost their lives in the earthquake, and 
		commit ourselves to stand with the people of Haiti until they can stand 
		on their own two feet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Amidst this upheaval, we 
		have also been persistent in our pursuit of peace.&nbsp; Last year, I pledged 
		my best efforts to support the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, 
		living side by side in peace and security, as part of a comprehensive 
		peace between Israel and all of its neighbors.&nbsp; We have travelled a 
		winding road over the last 12 months, with few peaks and many valleys.&nbsp; 
		But this month, I am pleased that we have pursued direct negotiations 
		between Israelis and Palestinians in Washington, Sharm el Sheikh and 
		Jerusalem.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now I recognize many are 
		pessimistic about this process.&nbsp; The cynics say that Israelis and 
		Palestinians are too distrustful of each other, and too divided 
		internally, to forge lasting peace.&nbsp; Rejectionists on both sides will 
		try to disrupt the process, with bitter words and with bombs and with 
		gunfire.&nbsp; Some say that the gaps between the parties are too big; the 
		potential for talks to break down is too great; and that after decades 
		of failure, peace is simply not possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I hear those voices of 
		skepticism.&nbsp; But I ask you to consider the alternative.&nbsp; If an agreement 
		is not reached, Palestinians will never know the pride and dignity that 
		comes with their own state.&nbsp; Israelis will never know the certainty and 
		security that comes with sovereign and stable neighbors who are 
		committed to coexistence.&nbsp; The hard realities of demography will take 
		hold.&nbsp; More blood will be shed.&nbsp; This Holy Land will remain a symbol of 
		our differences, instead of our common humanity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I refuse to accept that 
		future.&nbsp; And we all have a choice to make.&nbsp; Each of us must choose the 
		path of peace.&nbsp; Of course, that responsibility begins with the parties 
		themselves, who must answer the call of history.&nbsp; Earlier this month at 
		the White House, I was struck by the words of both the Israeli and 
		Palestinian leaders.&nbsp; Prime Minister Netanyahu said, “I came here today 
		to find a historic compromise that will enable both people to live in 
		peace, security, and dignity.”&nbsp; And President Abbas said, “We will spare 
		no effort and we will work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these 
		negotiations achieve their cause.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These words must now be 
		followed by action and I believe that both leaders have the courage to 
		do so.&nbsp; But the road that they have to travel is exceedingly difficult, 
		which is why I call upon Israelis and Palestinians -- and the world -- 
		to rally behind the goal that these leaders now share.&nbsp; We know that 
		there will be tests along the way and that one test is fast 
		approaching.&nbsp; Israel’s settlement moratorium has made a difference on 
		the ground and improved the atmosphere for talks.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And our position on this 
		issue is well known.&nbsp; We believe that the moratorium should be 
		extended.&nbsp; We also believe that talks should press on until completed.&nbsp; 
		Now is the time for the parties to help each other overcome this 
		obstacle.&nbsp; Now is the time to build the trust -- and provide the time -- 
		for substantial progress to be made.&nbsp; Now is the time for this 
		opportunity to be seized, so that it does not slip away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, peace must be made by 
		Israelis and Palestinians, but each of us has a responsibility to do our 
		part as well.&nbsp; Those of us who are friends of Israel must understand 
		that true security for the Jewish state requires an independent 
		Palestine -- one that allows the Palestinian people to live with dignity 
		and opportunity.&nbsp; And those of us who are friends of the Palestinians 
		must understand that the rights of the Palestinian people will be won 
		only through peaceful means -- including genuine reconciliation with a 
		secure Israel.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know many in this hall 
		count themselves as friends of the Palestinians.&nbsp; But these pledges of 
		friendship must now be supported by deeds.&nbsp; Those who have signed on to 
		the Arab Peace Initiative should seize this opportunity to make it real 
		by taking tangible steps towards the normalization that it promises 
		Israel.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And those who speak on 
		behalf of Palestinian self-government should help the Palestinian 
		Authority politically and financially, and in doing so help the 
		Palestinians build the institutions of their state.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who long to see an 
		independent Palestine must also stop trying to tear down Israel.&nbsp; After 
		thousands of years, Jews and Arabs are not strangers in a strange land.&nbsp; 
		After 60 years in the community of nations, Israel’s existence must not 
		be a subject for debate.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Israel is a sovereign state, 
		and the historic homeland of the Jewish people.&nbsp; It should be clear to 
		all that efforts to chip away at Israel’s legitimacy will only be met by 
		the unshakeable opposition of the United States.&nbsp; And efforts to 
		threaten or kill Israelis will do nothing to help the Palestinian 
		people.&nbsp; The slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance -- it’s 
		injustice.&nbsp; And make no mistake:&nbsp; The courage of a man like President 
		Abbas, who stands up for his people in front of the world under very 
		difficult circumstances, is far greater than those who fire rockets at 
		innocent women and children.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The conflict between 
		Israelis and Arabs is as old as this institution.&nbsp; And we can come back 
		here next year, as we have for the last 60 years, and make long speeches 
		about it.&nbsp; We can read familiar lists of grievances.&nbsp; We can table the 
		same resolutions.&nbsp; We can further empower the forces of rejectionism and 
		hate.&nbsp; And we can waste more time by carrying forward an argument that 
		will not help a single Israeli or Palestinian child achieve a better 
		life.&nbsp; We can do that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Or, we can say that this 
		time will be different -- that this time we will not let terror, or 
		turbulence, or posturing, or petty politics stand in the way.&nbsp; This 
		time, we will think not of ourselves, but of the young girl in Gaza who 
		wants to have no ceiling on her dreams, or the young boy in Sderot who 
		wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This time, we should draw 
		upon the teachings of tolerance that lie at the heart of three great 
		religions that see Jerusalem’s soil as sacred.&nbsp; This time we should 
		reach for what’s best within ourselves.&nbsp; If we do, when we come back 
		here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member 
		of the United Nations -- an independent, sovereign state of Palestine, 
		living in peace with Israel.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is our destiny to bear 
		the burdens of the challenges that I’ve addressed -- recession and war 
		and conflict.&nbsp; And there is always a sense of urgency -- even emergency 
		-- that drives most of our foreign policies.&nbsp; Indeed, after millennia 
		marked by wars, this very institution reflects the desire of human 
		beings to create a forum to deal with emergencies that will inevitably 
		come.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But even as we confront 
		immediate challenges, we must also summon the foresight to look beyond 
		them, and consider what we are trying to build over the long term?&nbsp; What 
		is the world that awaits us when today’s battles are brought to an end?&nbsp; 
		And that is what I would like to talk about with the remainder of my 
		time today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the first actions of 
		this General Assembly was to adopt a Universal Declaration of Human 
		Rights in 1948. That Declaration begins by stating that, “recognition of 
		the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all 
		members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and 
		peace in the world.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The idea is a simple one -- 
		that freedom, justice and peace for the world must begin with freedom, 
		justice, and peace in the lives of individual human beings.&nbsp; And for the 
		United States, this is a matter of moral and pragmatic necessity.&nbsp; As 
		Robert Kennedy said, “the individual man, the child of God, is the 
		touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his 
		benefit.”&nbsp; So we stand up for universal values because it’s the right 
		thing to do.&nbsp; But we also know from experience that those who defend 
		these values for their people have been our closest friends and allies, 
		while those who have denied those rights -- whether terrorist groups or 
		tyrannical governments -- have chosen to be our adversaries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Human rights have never gone 
		unchallenged -- not in any of our nations, and not in our world.&nbsp; 
		Tyranny is still with us -- whether it manifests itself in the Taliban 
		killing girls who try to go to school, a North Korean regime that 
		enslaves its own people, or an armed group in Congo-Kinshasa that use 
		rape as a weapon of war.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In times of economic unease, 
		there can also be an anxiety about human rights.&nbsp; Today, as in past 
		times of economic downturn, some put human rights aside for the promise 
		of short term stability or the false notion that economic growth can 
		come at the expense of freedom.&nbsp; We see leaders abolishing term limits.&nbsp; 
		We see crackdowns on civil society.&nbsp; We see corruption smothering 
		entrepreneurship and good governance.&nbsp; We see democratic reforms 
		deferred indefinitely.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As I said last year, each 
		country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its own people.&nbsp; Yet 
		experience shows us that history is on the side of liberty; that the 
		strongest foundation for human progress lies in open economies, open 
		societies, and open governments.&nbsp; To put it simply, democracy, more than 
		any other form of government, delivers for our citizens.&nbsp; And I believe 
		that truth will only grow stronger in a world where the borders between 
		nations are blurred.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America is working to shape 
		a world that fosters this openness, for the rot of a closed or corrupt 
		economy must never eclipse the energy and innovation of human beings.&nbsp; 
		All of us want the right to educate our children, to make a decent wage, 
		to care for the sick, and to be carried as far as our dreams and our 
		deeds will take us.&nbsp; But that depends upon economies that tap the power 
		of our people, including the potential of women and girls.&nbsp; That means 
		letting entrepreneurs start a business without paying a bribe and 
		governments that support opportunity instead of stealing from their 
		people.&nbsp; And that means rewarding hard work, instead of reckless 
		risk-taking.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yesterday, I put forward a 
		new development policy that will pursue these goals, recognizing that 
		dignity is a human right and global development is in our common 
		interest.&nbsp; America will partner with nations that offer their people a 
		path out of poverty.&nbsp; And together, we must unleash growth that powers 
		by individuals and emerging markets in all parts of the globe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no reason why 
		Africa should not be an exporter of agriculture, which is why our food 
		security initiative is empowering farmers.&nbsp; There is no reason why 
		entrepreneurs shouldn’t be able to build new markets in every society, 
		which is why I hosted a summit on entrepreneurship earlier this spring, 
		because the obligation of government is to empower individuals, not to 
		impede them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The same holds true for 
		civil society.&nbsp; The arc of human progress has been shaped by individuals 
		with the freedom to assemble and by organizations outside of government 
		that insisted upon democratic change and by free media that held the 
		powerful accountable.&nbsp; We have seen that from the South Africans who 
		stood up to apartheid, to the Poles of Solidarity, to the mothers of the 
		disappeared who spoke out against the Dirty War, to Americans who 
		marched for the rights of all races, including my own.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Civil society is the 
		conscience of our communities and America will always extend our 
		engagement abroad with citizens beyond the halls of government.&nbsp; And we 
		will call out those who suppress ideas and serve as a voice for those 
		who are voiceless.&nbsp; We will promote new tools of communication so people 
		are empowered to connect with one another and, in repressive societies, 
		to do so with security.&nbsp; We will support a free and open Internet, so 
		individuals have the information to make up their own minds.&nbsp; And it is 
		time to embrace and effectively monitor norms that advance the rights of 
		civil society and guarantee its expansion within and across borders.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Open society supports open 
		government, but it cannot substitute for it.&nbsp; There is no right more 
		fundamental than the ability to choose your leaders and determine your 
		destiny.&nbsp; Now, make no mistake:&nbsp; The ultimate success of democracy in 
		the world won’t come because the United States dictates it; it will come 
		because individual citizens demand a say in how they are governed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no soil where this 
		notion cannot take root, just as every democracy reflects the uniqueness 
		of a nation.&nbsp; Later this fall, I will travel to Asia.&nbsp; And I will visit 
		India, which peacefully threw off colonialism and established a thriving 
		democracy of over a billion people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ll continue to Indonesia, 
		the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, which binds together 
		thousands of islands through the glue of representative government and 
		civil society.&nbsp; I’ll join the G20 meeting on the Korean Peninsula, which 
		provides the world’s clearest contrast between a society that is dynamic 
		and open and free, and one that is imprisoned and closed.&nbsp; And I will 
		conclude my trip in Japan, an ancient culture that found peace and 
		extraordinary development through democracy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Each of these countries 
		gives life to democratic principles in their own way.&nbsp; And even as some 
		governments roll back reform, we also celebrate the courage of a 
		President in Colombia who willingly stepped aside, or the promise of a 
		new constitution in Kenya.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The common thread of 
		progress is the principle that government is accountable to its 
		citizens.&nbsp; And the diversity in this room makes clear -- no one country 
		has all the answers, but all of us must answer to our own people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In all parts of the world, 
		we see the promise of innovation to make government more open and 
		accountable.&nbsp; And now, we must build on that progress.&nbsp; And when we 
		gather back here next year, we should bring specific commitments to 
		promote transparency; to fight corruption; to energize civic engagement; 
		to leverage new technologies so that we strengthen the foundations of 
		freedom in our own countries, while living up to the ideals that can 
		light the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This institution can still 
		play an indispensable role in the advance of human rights.&nbsp; It’s 
		time to welcome the efforts of U.N. Women to protect the rights of women 
		around the globe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s time for every member 
		state to open its elections to international monitors and increase the 
		U.N. Democracy Fund.&nbsp; It’s time to reinvigorate U.N. peacekeeping, so 
		that missions have the resources necessary to succeed, and so atrocities 
		like sexual violence are prevented and justice is enforced -- because 
		neither dignity nor democracy can thrive without basic security.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it’s time to make this 
		institution more accountable as well, because the challenges of a new 
		century demand new ways of serving our common interests.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The world that America seeks 
		is not one we can build on our own.&nbsp; For human rights to reach those who 
		suffer the boot of oppression, we need your voices to speak out.&nbsp; In 
		particular, I appeal to those nations who emerged from tyranny and 
		inspired the world in the second half of the last century -- from South 
		Africa to South Asia; from Eastern Europe to South America.&nbsp; Don’t stand 
		idly by, don’t be silent, when dissidents elsewhere are imprisoned and 
		protesters are beaten.&nbsp; Recall your own history.&nbsp; Because part of the 
		price of our own freedom is standing up for the freedom of others.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That belief will guide 
		America’s leadership in this 21st century.&nbsp; It is a belief that has seen 
		us through more than two centuries of trial, and it will see us through 
		the challenges we face today -- be it war or recession; conflict or 
		division.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So even as we have come 
		through a difficult decade, I stand here before you confident in the 
		future -- a future where Iraq is governed by neither tyrant nor a 
		foreign power, and Afghanistan is freed from the turmoil of war; a 
		future where the children of Israel and Palestine can build the peace 
		that was not possible for their parents; a world where the promise of 
		development reaches into the prisons of poverty and disease; a future 
		where the cloud of recession gives way to the light of renewal and the 
		dream of opportunity is available to all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This future will not be easy 
		to reach.&nbsp; It will not come without setbacks, nor will it be quickly 
		claimed.&nbsp; But the founding of the United Nations itself is a testament 
		to human progress.&nbsp; Remember, in times that were far more trying than 
		our own, our predecessors chose the hope of unity over the ease of 
		division and made a promise to future generations that the dignity and 
		equality of human beings would be our common cause.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		It falls to us to fulfill that promise.&nbsp; And though we will be met by 
		dark forces that will test our resolve, Americans have always had cause 
		to believe that we can choose a better history; that we need only to 
		look outside the walls around us.&nbsp; For through the citizens of every 
		conceivable ancestry who make this city their own, we see living proof 
		that opportunity can be accessed by all, that what unites us as human 
		beings is far greater than what divides us, and that people from every 
		part of this world can live together in peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.</font></p>
