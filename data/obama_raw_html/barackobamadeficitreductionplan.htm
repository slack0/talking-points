<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good evening.&nbsp; Tonight, I 
		want to talk about the debate we’ve been having in Washington over the 
		national debt -- a debate that directly affects the lives of all 
		Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For the last decade, we’ve 
		spent more money than we take in.&nbsp; In the year 2000, the government had 
		a budget surplus.&nbsp; But instead of using it to pay off our debt, the 
		money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars 
		and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our 
		nation’s credit card.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a result, the deficit 
		was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.&nbsp; To make matters 
		worse, the recession meant that there was less money coming in, and it 
		required us to spend even more -– on tax cuts for middle-class families 
		to spur the economy; on unemployment insurance; on aid to states so we 
		could prevent more teachers and firefighters and police officers from 
		being laid off.&nbsp; These emergency steps also added to the deficit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, every family knows 
		that a little credit card debt is manageable.&nbsp; But if we stay on the 
		current path, our growing debt could cost us jobs and do serious damage 
		to the economy.&nbsp; More of our tax dollars will go toward paying off the 
		interest on our loans.&nbsp; Businesses will be less likely to open up shop 
		and hire workers in a country that can’t balance its books.&nbsp; Interest 
		rates could climb for everyone who borrows money -– the homeowner with a 
		mortgage, the student with a college loan, the corner store that wants 
		to expand.&nbsp; And we won’t have enough money to make job-creating 
		investments in things like education and infrastructure, or pay for 
		vital programs like Medicare and Medicaid.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because neither party is 
		blameless for the decisions that led to this problem, both parties have 
		a responsibility to solve it.&nbsp; And over the last several months, that’s 
		what we’ve been trying to do.&nbsp; I won’t bore you with the details of 
		every plan or proposal, but basically, the debate has centered around 
		two different approaches.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first approach says, 
		let’s live within our means by making serious, historic cuts in 
		government spending.&nbsp; Let’s cut domestic spending to the lowest level 
		it’s been since Dwight Eisenhower was President.&nbsp; Let’s cut defense 
		spending at the Pentagon by hundreds of billions of dollars.&nbsp; Let’s cut 
		out waste and fraud in health care programs like Medicare -- and at the 
		same time, let’s make modest adjustments so that Medicare is still there 
		for future generations.&nbsp; Finally, let’s ask the wealthiest Americans and 
		biggest corporations to give up some of their breaks in the tax code and 
		special deductions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This balanced approach 
		asks everyone to give a little without requiring anyone to sacrifice too 
		much.&nbsp; It would reduce the deficit by around $4 trillion and put us on a 
		path to pay down our debt.&nbsp; And the cuts wouldn’t happen so abruptly 
		that they’d be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from helping small 
		businesses and middle-class families get back on their feet right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This approach is also 
		bipartisan.&nbsp; While many in my own party aren’t happy with the painful 
		cuts it makes, enough will be willing to accept them if the burden is 
		fairly shared.&nbsp; While Republicans might like to see deeper cuts and no 
		revenue at all, there are many in the Senate who have said, “Yes, I’m 
		willing to put politics aside and consider this approach because I care 
		about solving the problem.”&nbsp; And to his credit, this is the kind of 
		approach the Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, was working 
		on with me over the last several weeks.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The only reason this 
		balanced approach isn’t on its way to becoming law right now is because 
		a significant number of Republicans in Congress are insisting on a 
		different approach -- a cuts-only approach -– an approach that doesn’t 
		ask the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to contribute 
		anything at all.&nbsp; And because nothing is asked of those at the top of 
		the income scale, such an approach would close the deficit only with 
		more severe cuts to programs we all care about –- cuts that place a 
		greater burden on working families.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the debate right now 
		isn’t about whether we need to make tough choices.&nbsp; Democrats and 
		Republicans agree on the amount of deficit reduction we need.&nbsp; The 
		debate is about how it should be done.&nbsp; Most Americans, regardless of 
		political party, don’t understand how we can ask a senior citizen to pay 
		more for her Medicare before we ask a corporate jet owner or the oil 
		companies to give up tax breaks that other companies don’t get.&nbsp; How can 
		we ask a student to pay more for college before we ask hedge fund 
		managers to stop paying taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries?&nbsp; 
		How can we slash funding for education and clean energy before we ask 
		people like me to give up tax breaks we don’t need and didn’t ask for?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s not right.&nbsp; It’s 
		not fair.&nbsp; We all want a government that lives within its means, but 
		there are still things we need to pay for as a country -– things like 
		new roads and bridges; weather satellites and food inspection; services 
		to veterans and medical research.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And keep in mind that 
		under a balanced approach, the 98 percent of Americans who make under 
		$250,000 would see no tax increases at all.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; In fact, I want to 
		extend the payroll tax cut for working families.&nbsp; What we’re talking 
		about under a balanced approach is asking Americans whose incomes have 
		gone up the most over the last decade -– millionaires and billionaires 
		-– to share in the sacrifice everyone else has to make.&nbsp; And I think 
		these patriotic Americans are willing to pitch in.&nbsp; In fact, over the 
		last few decades, they’ve pitched in every time we passed a bipartisan 
		deal to reduce the deficit.&nbsp; The first time a deal was passed, a 
		predecessor of mine made the case for a balanced approach by saying 
		this:</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">“Would you rather reduce 
		deficits and interest rates by raising revenue from those who are not 
		now paying their fair share, or would you rather accept larger budget 
		deficits, higher interest rates, and higher unemployment?&nbsp; And I think I 
		know your answer.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those words were spoken by 
		Ronald Reagan.&nbsp; But today, many Republicans in the House refuse to 
		consider this kind of balanced approach -– an approach that was pursued 
		not only by President Reagan, but by the first President Bush, by 
		President Clinton, by myself, and by many Democrats and Republicans in 
		the United States Senate.&nbsp; So we’re left with a stalemate.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, what makes today’s 
		stalemate so dangerous is that it has been tied to something known as 
		the debt ceiling -– a term that most people outside of Washington have 
		probably never heard of before.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Understand –- raising the 
		debt ceiling does not allow Congress to spend more money.&nbsp; It simply 
		gives our country the ability to pay the bills that Congress has already 
		racked up.&nbsp; In the past, raising the debt ceiling was routine.&nbsp; Since 
		the 1950s, Congress has always passed it, and every President has signed 
		it.&nbsp; President Reagan did it 18 times.&nbsp; George W. Bush did it seven 
		times.&nbsp; And we have to do it by next Tuesday, August 2nd, or else we 
		won’t be able to pay all of our bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, for the 
		past several weeks, Republican House members have essentially said that 
		the only way they’ll vote to prevent America’s first-ever default is if 
		the rest of us agree to their deep, spending cuts-only approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If that happens, and we 
		default, we would not have enough money to pay all of our bills -– bills 
		that include monthly Social Security checks, veterans’ benefits, and the 
		government contracts we’ve signed with thousands of businesses.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For the first time in 
		history, our country’s AAA credit rating would be downgraded, leaving 
		investors around the world to wonder whether the United States is still 
		a good bet.&nbsp; Interest rates would skyrocket on credit cards, on 
		mortgages and on car loans, which amounts to a huge tax hike on the 
		American people.&nbsp; We would risk sparking a deep economic crisis -– this 
		one caused almost entirely by Washington.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So defaulting on our 
		obligations is a reckless and irresponsible outcome to this debate.&nbsp; And 
		Republican leaders say that they agree we must avoid default.&nbsp; But the 
		new approach that Speaker Boehner unveiled today, which would 
		temporarily extend the debt ceiling in exchange for spending cuts, would 
		force us to once again face the threat of default just six months from 
		now.&nbsp; In other words, it doesn’t solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First of all, a six-month 
		extension of the debt ceiling might not be enough to avoid a credit 
		downgrade and the higher interest rates that all Americans would have to 
		pay as a result.&nbsp; We know what we have to do to reduce our deficits; 
		there’s no point in putting the economy at risk by kicking the can 
		further down the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there’s an even 
		greater danger to this approach.&nbsp; Based on what we’ve seen these past 
		few weeks, we know what to expect six months from now.&nbsp; The House of 
		Representatives will once again refuse to prevent default unless the 
		rest of us accept their cuts-only approach.&nbsp; Again, they will refuse to 
		ask the wealthiest Americans to give up their tax cuts or deductions.&nbsp; 
		Again, they will demand harsh cuts to programs like Medicare.&nbsp; And once 
		again, the economy will be held captive unless they get their way.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is no way to run the 
		greatest country on Earth.&nbsp; It’s a dangerous game that we’ve never 
		played before, and we can’t afford to play it now.&nbsp; Not when the jobs 
		and livelihoods of so many families are at stake.&nbsp; We can’t allow the 
		American people to become collateral damage to Washington’s political 
		warfare.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Congress now has one week 
		left to act, and there are still paths forward.&nbsp; The Senate has 
		introduced a plan to avoid default, which makes a down payment on 
		deficit reduction and ensures that we don’t have to go through this 
		again in six months.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think that’s a much 
		better approach, although serious deficit reduction would still require 
		us to tackle the tough challenges of entitlement and tax reform.&nbsp; Either 
		way, I’ve told leaders of both parties that they must come up with a 
		fair compromise in the next few days that can pass both houses of 
		Congress -– and a compromise that I can sign.&nbsp; I’m confident we can 
		reach this compromise.&nbsp; Despite our disagreements, Republican leaders 
		and I have found common ground before.&nbsp; And I believe that enough 
		members of both parties will ultimately put politics aside and help us 
		make progress.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I realize that a lot 
		of the new members of Congress and I don’t see eye-to-eye on many 
		issues.&nbsp; But we were each elected by some of the same Americans for some 
		of the same reasons.&nbsp; Yes, many want government to start living within 
		its means.&nbsp; And many are fed up with a system in which the deck seems 
		stacked against middle-class Americans in favor of the wealthiest few.&nbsp; 
		But do you know what people are fed up with most of all?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They’re fed up with a town 
		where compromise has become a dirty word.&nbsp; They work all day long, many 
		of them scraping by, just to put food on the table.&nbsp; And when these 
		Americans come home at night, bone-tired, and turn on the news, all they 
		see is the same partisan three-ring circus here in Washington.&nbsp; They see 
		leaders who can’t seem to come together and do what it takes to make 
		life just a little bit better for ordinary Americans.&nbsp; They’re offended 
		by that.&nbsp; And they should be.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The American people may 
		have voted for divided government, but they didn’t vote for a 
		dysfunctional government.&nbsp; So I’m asking you all to make your voice 
		heard.&nbsp; If you want a balanced approach to reducing the deficit, let 
		your member of Congress know.&nbsp; If you believe we can solve this problem 
		through compromise, send that message.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America, after all, has 
		always been a grand experiment in compromise.&nbsp; As a democracy made up of 
		every race and religion, where every belief and point of view is 
		welcomed, we have put to the test time and again the proposition at the 
		heart of our founding:&nbsp; that out of many, we are one.&nbsp; We’ve engaged in 
		fierce and passionate debates about the issues of the day, but from 
		slavery to war, from civil liberties to questions of economic justice, 
		we have tried to live by the words that Jefferson once wrote:&nbsp; “Every 
		man cannot have his way in all things -- without this mutual 
		disposition, we are disjointed individuals, but not a society.”&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">History is scattered with 
		the stories of those who held fast to rigid ideologies and refused to 
		listen to those who disagreed.&nbsp; But those are not the Americans we 
		remember.&nbsp; We remember the Americans who put country above self, and set 
		personal grievances aside for the greater good.&nbsp; We remember the 
		Americans who held this country together during its most difficult 
		hours; who put aside pride and party to form a more perfect union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s who we remember.&nbsp; 
		That’s who we need to be right now.&nbsp; The entire world is watching.&nbsp; So 
		let’s seize this moment to show why the United States of America is 
		still the greatest nation on Earth –- not just because we can still keep 
		our word and meet our obligations, but because we can still come 
		together as one nation.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, God bless you, 
		and may God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
