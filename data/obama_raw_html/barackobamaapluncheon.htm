<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, good afternoon, and 
		-- and thank you to Dean Singleton and the board of the Associated Press for 
		inviting me here today.&nbsp; It is a pleasure to speak to all of you -- and 
		to have a microphone that I can see.&nbsp; Feel free to
		<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/26/nuclear-summit-barack-obama-medvedev_n_1379422.html">
		<font color="#0000FF">transmit any of 
		this to Vladimir</font></a> if you see him.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Clearly, we’re already in 
		the beginning months of another long, lively election year.&nbsp; There will 
		be gaffes and minor controversies, be hot mics and Etch-a-Sketch 
		moments.&nbsp; You will cover every word that we say, and we will complain 
		vociferously about the unflattering words that you write -- unless, of 
		course, you're writing about the other guy -- in which case, good job.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there are also big, 
		fundamental issues at stake right now -- issues that deserve serious 
		debate among every candidate, and serious coverage among every 
		reporter.&nbsp; Whoever he may be, the next President will inherit an economy 
		that is recovering, but not yet recovered, from the worst economic 
		calamity since the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">
		<font color="#0000FF">Great Depression</font></a>.&nbsp; Too many Americans will still be 
		looking for a job that pays enough to cover their bills or their 
		mortgage.&nbsp; Too many citizens will still lack the sort of financial 
		security that started slipping away years before this recession hit.&nbsp; A 
		debt that has grown over the last decade, primarily as a result of two 
		wars, two massive tax cuts, and an unprecedented financial crisis, will 
		have to be paid down.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the face of all these 
		challenges, we're going to have to answer a central question as a 
		nation:&nbsp; What, if anything, can we do to restore a sense of security for 
		people who are willing to work hard and act responsibly in this 
		country?&nbsp; Can we succeed as a country where a shrinking number of people 
		do exceedingly well, while a growing number struggle to get by?&nbsp; Or are 
		we better off when everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their 
		fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is not just another 
		run-of-the-mill political debate.&nbsp; I’ve said it’s the defining issue of 
		our time, and I believe it. It’s why I ran in 2008.&nbsp; It’s what my 
		presidency has been about. It’s why I’m running again.&nbsp; I believe this 
		is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and I can’t remember a 
		time when the choice between competing visions of our future has been so 
		unambiguously clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Keep in mind, I have never 
		been somebody who believes that government can or should try to solve 
		every problem.&nbsp; Some of you know my first job in Chicago was working 
		with a group of Catholic churches that often did more good for the 
		people in their communities than any government program could.&nbsp; In those 
		same communities I saw that no education policy, however well crafted, 
		can take the place of a parent’s love and attention.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As President, I’ve 
		eliminated dozens of programs that weren’t working, and announced over 
		500 regulatory reforms that will save businesses and taxpayers billions, 
		and put annual domestic spending on a path to become the smallest share 
		of the economy since Dwight Eisenhower held this office -- since before 
		I was born.&nbsp; I know that the true engine of job creation in this country 
		is the private sector, not Washington, which is why I’ve cut taxes for 
		small business owners 17 times over the last three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I believe deeply that the 
		free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human 
		history.&nbsp; My mother and the grandparents who raised me instilled the 
		values of self-reliance and personal responsibility that remain the 
		cornerstone of the American idea.&nbsp; But I also share the belief of our 
		first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln -- a belief that, through 
		government, we should do together what we cannot do as well for 
		ourselves.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That belief is the reason 
		this country has been able to build a strong military to keep us safe, 
		and public schools to educate our children.&nbsp; That belief is why we’ve 
		been able to lay down railroads and highways to facilitate travel and 
		commerce.&nbsp; That belief is why we’ve been able to support the work of 
		scientists and researchers whose discoveries have saved lives, and 
		unleashed repeated technological revolutions, and led to countless new 
		jobs and entire industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That belief is also why 
		we’ve sought to ensure that every citizen can count on some basic 
		measure of security.&nbsp; We do this because we recognize that no matter how 
		responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any moment, might face 
		hard times, might face bad luck, might face a crippling illness or a 
		layoff.&nbsp; And so we contribute to programs like Medicare and Social 
		Security, which guarantee health care and a source of income after a 
		lifetime of hard work.&nbsp; We provide unemployment insurance, which 
		protects us against unexpected job loss and facilitates the labor 
		mobility that makes our economy so dynamic.&nbsp; We provide for Medicaid, 
		which makes sure that millions of seniors in nursing homes and children 
		with disabilities are getting the care that they need.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For generations, nearly all 
		of these investments -- from transportation to education to retirement 
		programs -- have been supported by people in both parties.&nbsp; As much as 
		we might associate the G.I. Bill with Franklin Roosevelt, or Medicare 
		with Lyndon Johnson, it was a Republican, Lincoln, who launched the 
		Transcontinental Railroad, the National Academy of Sciences, land grant 
		colleges.&nbsp; It was Eisenhower who launched the Interstate Highway System 
		and new investment in scientific research.&nbsp; It was Richard Nixon who 
		created the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">
		<font color="#0000FF">Environmental Protection Agency</font></a>, Ronald Reagan who worked 
		with Democrats to save Social Security. It was George W. Bush who added 
		prescription drug coverage to Medicare.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		What leaders in both parties have traditionally understood is that these 
		investments aren’t part of some scheme to redistribute wealth from one 
		group to another.&nbsp; They are expressions of the fact that we are one 
		nation.&nbsp; These investments benefit us all.&nbsp; They contribute to genuine, 
		durable economic growth.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Show me a business leader 
		who wouldn’t profit if more Americans could afford to get the skills and 
		education that today’s jobs require.&nbsp; Ask any company where they’d 
		rather locate and hire workers -- a country with crumbling roads and 
		bridges, or one that’s committed to high-speed Internet and high-speed 
		railroads and high-tech research and development?&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It doesn’t make us weaker 
		when we guarantee basic security for the elderly or the sick or those 
		who are actively looking for work.&nbsp; What makes us weaker is when fewer 
		and fewer people can afford to buy the goods and services our businesses 
		sell, or when entrepreneurs don’t have the financial security to take a 
		chance and start a new business.&nbsp; What drags down our entire economy is 
		when there’s an ever-widening chasm between the ultra-rich and everybody 
		else.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this country, broad-based 
		prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few.&nbsp; 
		It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle 
		class.&nbsp; That’s how a generation who went to college on the G.I. Bill, 
		including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy the 
		world has ever known.&nbsp; That’s why a CEO like 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford"><font color="#0000FF">Henry Ford</font></a> made it his 
		mission to pay his workers enough so they could buy the cars that they 
		made.&nbsp; That’s why research has shown that countries with less inequality 
		tend to have stronger and steadier economic growth over the long run.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, for much of the 
		last century, we have been having the same argument with folks who keep 
		peddling some version of trickle-down economics.&nbsp; They keep telling us 
		that if we’d convert more of our investments in education and research 
		and health care into tax cuts -- especially for the wealthy -- our 
		economy will grow stronger.&nbsp; They keep telling us that if we’d just 
		strip away more regulations, and let businesses pollute more and treat 
		workers and consumers with impunity, that somehow we’d all be better 
		off.&nbsp; We’re told that when the wealthy become even wealthier, and 
		corporations are allowed to maximize their profits by whatever means 
		necessary, it’s good for America, and that their success will 
		automatically translate into more jobs and prosperity for everybody 
		else.&nbsp; That’s the theory.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the problem for 
		advocates of this theory is that we’ve tried their approach -- on a 
		massive scale.&nbsp; The results of their experiment are there for all to 
		see.&nbsp; At the beginning of the last decade, the wealthiest Americans 
		received a huge tax cut in 2001 and another huge tax cut in 2003.&nbsp; We 
		were promised that these tax cuts would lead to faster job growth.&nbsp; They 
		did not.&nbsp; The wealthy got wealthier -- we would expect that.&nbsp; The income 
		of the top 1 percent has grown by more than 275 percent over the last 
		few decades, to an average of $1.3 million a year.&nbsp; But prosperity sure 
		didn't trickle down.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Instead, during the last 
		decade, we had the slowest job growth in half a century.&nbsp; And the 
		typical American family actually saw their incomes fall by about 6 
		percent, even as the economy was growing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was a period when 
		insurance companies and mortgage lenders and financial institutions 
		didn’t have to abide by strong enough regulations, or they found their 
		ways around them.&nbsp; And what was the result?&nbsp; Profits for many of these 
		companies soared. But so did people’s health insurance premiums.&nbsp; 
		Patients were routinely denied care, often when they needed it most.&nbsp; 
		Families were enticed, and sometimes just plain tricked, into buying 
		homes they couldn’t afford.&nbsp; Huge, reckless bets were made with other 
		people’s money on the line.&nbsp; And our entire financial system was nearly 
		destroyed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we tried this theory 
		out.&nbsp; And you would think that after the results of this experiment in 
		trickle-down economics, after the results were made painfully clear, 
		that the proponents of this theory might show some humility, might 
		moderate their views a bit.&nbsp; You'd think they’d say, you know what, 
		maybe some rules and regulations are necessary to protect the economy 
		and prevent people from being taken advantage of by insurance companies 
		or credit card companies or mortgage lenders.&nbsp; Maybe, just maybe, at a 
		time of growing debt and widening inequality, we should hold off on 
		giving the wealthiest Americans another round of big tax cuts.&nbsp; Maybe 
		when we know that most of today’s middle-class jobs require more than a 
		high school degree, we shouldn’t gut education, or lay off thousands of 
		teachers, or raise interest rates on college loans, or take away 
		people’s financial aid.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But that’s exactly the 
		opposite of what they’ve done.&nbsp; Instead of moderating their views even 
		slightly, the Republicans running Congress right now have doubled down, 
		and proposed a budget so far to the right it makes the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_with_America">
		<font color="#0000FF">Contract with 
		America</font></a> look like the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal"><font color="#0000FF">New Deal</font></a>.&nbsp; In fact, that renowned 
		liberal, Newt Gingrich, first called the original version of the budget 
		&quot;radical&quot; and said it would contribute to &quot;right-wing social 
		engineering.&quot;&nbsp; This is coming from Newt Gingrich.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
		And yet, this isn’t a budget supported by some small rump group in the 
		Republican Party.&nbsp; This is now the party’s governing platform.&nbsp; This is 
		what they’re running on.&nbsp; One of my potential opponents, Governor 
		Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last 
		year would be introduced as a bill on day one of his presidency.&nbsp; He 
		said that he’s “very supportive” of this new budget, and he even called 
		it &quot;marvelous&quot; -- which is a word you don’t often hear when it comes to 
		describing a budget.&nbsp; It’s a word you don’t often hear 
		generally.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So here’s what this 
		&quot;marvelous&quot; budget does.&nbsp; Back in the summer, I came to an agreement 
		with Republicans in Congress to cut roughly $1 trillion in annual 
		spending.&nbsp; Some of these cuts were about getting rid of waste; others 
		were about programs that we support but just can’t afford given our 
		deficits and our debt.&nbsp; And part of the agreement was a guarantee of 
		another trillion in savings, for a total of about $2 trillion in deficit 
		reduction.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This new House Republican 
		budget, however, breaks our bipartisan agreement and proposes massive 
		new cuts in annual domestic spending -- exactly the area where we’ve 
		already cut the most.&nbsp; And I want to actually go through what it would 
		mean for our country if these cuts were to be spread out evenly.&nbsp; So 
		bear with me.&nbsp; I want to go through this -- because I don’t think people 
		fully appreciate the nature of this budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The year after next, nearly 
		10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an 
		average of more than $1,000 each.&nbsp; There would be 1,600 fewer medical 
		grants, research grants for things like Alzheimer’s and cancer and 
		AIDS.&nbsp; There would be 4,000 fewer scientific research grants, 
		eliminating support for 48,000 researchers, students, and teachers.&nbsp; 
		Investments in clean energy technologies that are helping us reduce our 
		dependence on foreign oil would be cut by nearly a fifth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If this budget becomes law 
		and the cuts were applied evenly, starting in 2014, over 200,000 
		children would lose their chance to get an early education in the 
		<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Head_Start_Program">
		<font color="#0000FF">Head 
		Start Program</font></a>.&nbsp; Two million mothers and young children would be cut from 
		a program that gives them access to healthy food.&nbsp; There would be 4,500 
		fewer federal grants at the Department of Justice and the FBI to combat 
		violent crime, financial crime, and help secure our borders.&nbsp; Hundreds 
		of national parks would be forced to close for part or all of the year.&nbsp; 
		We wouldn’t have the capacity to enforce the laws that protect the air 
		we breathe, the water we drink, or the food that we eat.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cuts to the FAA would likely 
		result in more flight cancellations, delays, and the complete 
		elimination of air traffic control services in parts of the country.&nbsp; 
		Over time, our weather forecasts would become less accurate because we 
		wouldn’t be able to afford to launch new satellites.&nbsp; And that means 
		governors and mayors would have to wait longer to order evacuations in 
		the event of a hurricane.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s just a partial 
		sampling of the consequences of this budget.&nbsp; Now, you can anticipate 
		Republicans may say, well, we’ll avoid some of these cuts -- since they 
		don’t specify exactly the cuts that they would make.&nbsp; But they can only 
		avoid some of these cuts if they cut even deeper in other areas.&nbsp; This 
		is math.&nbsp; If they want to make smaller cuts to medical research that 
		means they’ve got to cut even deeper in funding for things like teaching 
		and law enforcement.&nbsp; The converse is true as well.&nbsp; If they want to 
		protect early childhood education, it will mean further reducing things 
		like financial aid for young people trying to afford college.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps they will never tell 
		us where the knife will fall -- but you can be sure that with cuts this 
		deep, there is no secret plan or formula that will be able to protect 
		the investments we need to help our economy grow.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is not conjecture.&nbsp; I 
		am not exaggerating.&nbsp; These are facts.&nbsp; And these are just the cuts that 
		would happen the year after next.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If this budget became law, 
		by the middle of the century, funding for the kinds of things I just 
		mentioned would have to be cut by about 95 percent.&nbsp; Let me repeat 
		that.&nbsp; Those categories I just mentioned we would have to cut by 95 
		percent.&nbsp; As a practical matter, the federal budget would basically 
		amount to whatever is left in entitlements, defense spending, and 
		interest on the national debt -- period.&nbsp; Money for these investments 
		that have traditionally been supported on a bipartisan basis would be 
		practically eliminated.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the same is true for 
		other priorities like transportation, and homeland security, and 
		veterans programs for the men and women who have risked their lives for 
		this country.&nbsp; This is not an exaggeration.&nbsp; Check it out yourself.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is to say nothing 
		about what the budget does to health care.&nbsp; We’re told that Medicaid 
		would simply be handed over to the states -- that's the pitch:&nbsp; Let's 
		get it out of the central bureaucracy.&nbsp; The states can experiment.&nbsp; 
		They'll be able to run the programs a lot better.&nbsp; But here's the deal 
		the states would be getting.&nbsp; They would have to be running these 
		programs in the face of the largest cut to Medicaid that has ever been 
		proposed -- a cut that, according to one nonpartisan group, would take 
		away health care for about 19 million Americans -- 19 million.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Who are these Americans?&nbsp; 
		Many are someone’s grandparents who, without Medicaid, won't be able to 
		afford nursing home care without Medicaid.&nbsp; Many are poor children.&nbsp; 
		Some are middle-class families who have children with autism or Down’s 
		Syndrome.&nbsp; Some are kids with disabilities so severe that they require 
		24-hour care.&nbsp; These are the people who count on Medicaid.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then there’s Medicare.&nbsp; 
		Because health care costs keep rising and the Baby Boom generation is 
		retiring, Medicare, we all know, is one of the biggest drivers of our 
		long-term deficit.&nbsp; That’s a challenge we have to meet by bringing down 
		the cost of health care overall so that seniors and taxpayers can share 
		in the savings.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But here’s the solution 
		proposed by the Republicans in Washington, and embraced by most of their 
		candidates for president:&nbsp; Instead of being enrolled in Medicare when 
		they turn 65, seniors who retire a decade from now would get a voucher 
		that equals the cost of the second cheapest health care plan in their 
		area.&nbsp; If Medicare is more expensive than that private plan, they’ll 
		have to pay more if they want to enroll in traditional Medicare.&nbsp; If 
		health care costs rise faster than the amount of the voucher -- as, by 
		the way, they’ve been doing for decades -- that’s too bad.&nbsp; Seniors bear 
		the risk.&nbsp; If the voucher isn’t enough to buy a private plan with the 
		specific doctors and care that you need, that's too bad.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So most experts will tell 
		you the way this voucher plan encourages savings is not through better 
		care at cheaper cost.&nbsp; The way these private insurance companies save 
		money is by designing and marketing plans to attract the youngest and 
		healthiest seniors -- cherry-picking -- leaving the older and sicker 
		seniors in traditional Medicare, where they have access to a wide range 
		of doctors and guaranteed care.&nbsp; But that, of course, makes the 
		traditional Medicare program even more expensive, and raise premiums 
		even further.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The net result is that our 
		country will end up spending more on health care, and the only reason 
		the government will save any money -- it won’t be on our books -- is 
		because we’ve shifted it to seniors.&nbsp; They’ll bear more of the costs 
		themselves.&nbsp; It’s a bad idea, and it will ultimately end Medicare as we 
		know it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the proponents of this 
		budget will tell us we have to make all these draconian cuts because our 
		deficit is so large; this is an existential crisis, we have to think 
		about future generations, so on and so on.&nbsp; And that argument might have 
		a shred of credibility were it not for their proposal to also spend $4.6 
		trillion over the next decade on lower tax rates.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re told that these tax 
		cuts will supposedly be paid for by closing loopholes and eliminating 
		wasteful deductions.&nbsp; But the Republicans in Congress refuse to list a 
		single tax loophole they are willing to close.&nbsp; Not one.&nbsp; And by the 
		way, there is no way to get even close to $4.6 trillion in savings 
		without dramatically reducing all kinds of tax breaks that go to 
		middle-class families -- tax breaks for health care, tax breaks for 
		retirement, tax breaks for homeownership.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meanwhile, these proposed 
		tax breaks would come on top of more than a trillion dollars in tax 
		giveaways for people making more than $250,000 a year.&nbsp; That’s an 
		average of at least $150,000 for every millionaire in this country -- 
		$150,000.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let’s just step back for a 
		second and look at what $150,000 pays for:&nbsp; A year’s worth of 
		prescription drug coverage for a senior citizen.&nbsp; Plus a new school 
		computer lab.&nbsp; Plus a year of medical care for a returning veteran.&nbsp; 
		Plus a medical research grant for a chronic disease.&nbsp; Plus a year’s 
		salary for a firefighter or police officer.&nbsp; Plus a tax credit to make a 
		year of college more affordable.&nbsp; Plus a year’s worth of financial aid.&nbsp; 
		One hundred fifty thousand dollars could pay for all of these things 
		combined -- investments in education and research that are essential to 
		economic growth that benefits all of us.&nbsp; For $150,000, that would be 
		going to each millionaire and billionaire in this country.&nbsp; This budget 
		says we’d be better off as a country if that’s how we spend it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is supposed to be about 
		paying down our deficit?&nbsp; It’s laughable.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The bipartisan 
		<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Simpson-Bowles_plan">
		<font color="#0000FF">Simpson-Bowles commission</font></a> that I created -- which the Republicans 
		originally were for until I was for it -- that was about paying down the 
		deficit.&nbsp; And I didn’t agree with all the details.&nbsp; I proposed about 
		$600 billion more in revenue and $600 billion -- I'm sorry -- it 
		proposed about $600 billion more in revenue and about $600 billion more 
		in defense cuts than I proposed in my own budget.&nbsp; But Bowles-Simpson 
		was a serious, honest, balanced effort between Democrats and Republicans 
		to bring down the deficit.&nbsp; That’s why, although it differs in some 
		ways, my budget takes a similarly balanced approach:&nbsp; Cuts in 
		discretionary spending, cuts in mandatory spending, increased revenue.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This congressional 
		Republican budget is something different altogether.&nbsp; It is a Trojan 
		Horse.&nbsp; Disguised as deficit reduction plans, it is really an attempt to 
		impose a radical vision on our country.&nbsp; It is thinly veiled social 
		Darwinism.&nbsp; It is antithetical to our entire history as a land of 
		opportunity and upward mobility for everybody who’s willing to work for 
		it; a place where prosperity doesn’t trickle down from the top, but 
		grows outward from the heart of the middle class.&nbsp; And by gutting the 
		very things we need to grow an economy that’s built to last&nbsp;-- 
		education and training, research and development, our infrastructure -- 
		it is a prescription for decline.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And everybody here should 
		understand that because there's very few people here who haven't 
		benefitted at some point from those investments that were made in the 
		'50s and the '60s and the '70s and the '80s.&nbsp; That’s part of how we got 
		ahead.&nbsp; And now, we're going to be pulling up those ladders up for the 
		next generation?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So in the months ahead, I 
		will be fighting as hard as I know how for this truer vision of what the 
		United States of America is all about.&nbsp; Absolutely, we have to get 
		serious about the deficit. And that will require tough choices and 
		sacrifice.&nbsp; And I’ve already shown myself willing to make these tough 
		choices when I signed into law the biggest spending cut of any President 
		in recent memory.&nbsp; In fact, if you adjust for the economy, the 
		Congressional Budget Office says the overall spending next year will be 
		lower than any year under Ronald Reagan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I’m willing to make more 
		of those difficult spending decisions in the months ahead.&nbsp; But I’ve 
		said it before and I’ll say it again -- there has to be some balance.&nbsp; 
		All of us have to do our fair share.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ve also put forward a 
		detailed plan that would reform and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid.&nbsp; 
		By the beginning of the next decade, it achieves the same amount of 
		annual health savings as the plan proposed by Simpson-Bowles -- the 
		Simpson-Bowles commission, and it does so by making changes that people 
		in my party haven’t always been comfortable with.&nbsp; But instead of saving 
		money by shifting costs to seniors, like the congressional Republican 
		plan proposes, our approach would lower the cost of health care 
		throughout the entire system.&nbsp; It goes after excessive subsidies to 
		prescription drug companies.&nbsp; It gets more efficiency out of Medicaid 
		without gutting the program.&nbsp; It asks the very wealthiest seniors to pay 
		a little bit more.&nbsp; It changes the way we pay for health care -- not by 
		procedure or the number of days spent in a hospital, but with new 
		incentives for doctors and hospitals to improve their results.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it slows the growth of 
		Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission -- a 
		commission not made up of bureaucrats from government or insurance 
		companies, but doctors and nurses and medical experts and consumers, who 
		will look at all the evidence and recommend the best way to reduce 
		unnecessary health care spending while protecting access to the care 
		that the seniors need.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also have a much 
		different approach when it comes to taxes -- an approach that says if 
		we’re serious about paying down our debt, we can’t afford to spend 
		trillions more on tax cuts for folks like me, for wealthy Americans who 
		don’t need them and weren’t even asking for them, and that the country 
		cannot afford. At a time when the share of national income flowing to 
		the top 1 percent of people in this country has climbed to levels last 
		seen in the 1920s, those same folks are paying taxes at one of the 
		lowest rates in 50 years.&nbsp; As both I and Warren Buffett have pointed out 
		many times now, he’s paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.&nbsp; That 
		is not fair.&nbsp; It is not right.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the choice is really 
		very simple.&nbsp; If you want to keep these tax rates and deductions in 
		place -- or give even more tax breaks to the wealthy, as the Republicans 
		in Congress propose -- then one of two things happen:&nbsp; Either it means 
		higher deficits, or it means more sacrifice from the middle class.&nbsp; 
		Seniors will have to pay more for Medicare.&nbsp; College students will lose 
		some of their financial aid.&nbsp; Working families who are scraping by will 
		have to do more because the richest Americans are doing less.&nbsp; I repeat 
		what I’ve said before:&nbsp; That is not class warfare, that is not class 
		envy, that is math.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If that’s the choice that 
		members of Congress want to make, then we’re going to make sure every 
		American knows about it.&nbsp; In a few weeks, there will be a vote on what 
		we’ve called the Buffett Rule.&nbsp; Simple concept:&nbsp; If you make more than a 
		million dollars a year -- not that you have a million dollars -- if you 
		make more than a million dollars annually, then you should pay at least 
		the same percentage of your income in taxes as middle-class families 
		do.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year -- like 98 
		percent of American families do -- then your taxes shouldn’t go up.&nbsp; 
		That’s the proposal.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, you’ll hear some people 
		point out that the Buffett Rule alone won’t raise enough revenue to 
		solve our deficit problems.&nbsp; Maybe not, but it’s definitely a step in 
		the right direction.&nbsp; And I intend to keep fighting for this kind of 
		balance and fairness until the other side starts listening, because I 
		believe this is what the American people want.&nbsp; I believe this is the 
		best way to pay for the investments we need to grow our economy and 
		strengthen the middle class.&nbsp; And by the way, I believe it’s the right 
		thing to do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This larger debate that we 
		will be having and that you will be covering in the coming year about 
		the size and role of government, this debate has been with us since our 
		founding days. And during moments of great challenge and change, like 
		the ones that we’re living through now, the debate gets sharper; it gets 
		more vigorous.&nbsp; That’s a good thing.&nbsp; As a country that prizes both our 
		individual freedom and our obligations to one another, this is one of 
		the most important debates that we can have.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But no matter what we argue 
		or where we stand, we have always held certain beliefs as Americans.&nbsp; We 
		believe that in order to preserve our own freedoms and pursue our own 
		happiness, we can’t just think about ourselves.&nbsp; We have to think about 
		the country that made those liberties possible.&nbsp; We have to think about 
		our fellow citizens with whom we share a community.&nbsp; We have to think 
		about what’s required to preserve the American Dream for future 
		generations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this sense of 
		responsibility -- to each other and our country -- this isn’t a partisan 
		feeling.&nbsp; This isn’t a Democratic or Republican idea.&nbsp; It’s patriotism.&nbsp; 
		And if we keep that in mind, and uphold our obligations to one another 
		and to this larger enterprise that is America, then I have no doubt that 
		we will continue our long and prosperous journey as the greatest nation 
		on Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; 
		God bless the United States of America.</font></p>

		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/williamdeansingletonapluncheon2.jpg" width="208" height="141"> MR. 
		[WILLIAM DEAN] SINGLETON:&nbsp; Thank you, 
		Mr. President.&nbsp; We appreciate so much you being with us today.&nbsp; I have 
		some questions from the audience, which I will ask -- and I'll be more 
		careful than I was last time I did this.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Republicans have been 
		sharply critical of your budget ideas as well.&nbsp; What can you say to the 
		Americans who just want both sides to stop fighting and get some work 
		done on their behalf?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, I 
		completely understand the American people’s frustrations, because the 
		truth is that these are eminently solvable problems.&nbsp; I know that 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Lagarde">
		<font color="#0000FF">Christine Lagarde</font></a> is here from the IMF, and she’s looking at the books 
		of a lot of other countries around the world.&nbsp; The kinds of challenges 
		they face fiscally are so much more severe than anything that we 
		confront -- if we make some sensible decisions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the American people’s 
		impulses are absolutely right.&nbsp; These are solvable problems if people of 
		good faith came together and were willing to compromise.&nbsp; The challenge 
		we have right now is that we have on one side, a party that will brook 
		no compromise.&nbsp; And this is not just my assertion.&nbsp; We had presidential 
		candidates who stood on a stage and were asked, &quot;Would you accept a 
		budget package, a deficit reduction plan, that involved $10 of cuts for 
		every dollar in revenue increases?&quot; Ten-to-one ratio of spending cuts to 
		revenue.&nbsp; Not one of them raised their hand.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Think about that.&nbsp; Ronald 
		Reagan, who, as I recall, is not accused of being a tax-and-spend 
		socialist, understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get 
		out of control, that for him to make a deal he would have to propose 
		both spending cuts and tax increases.&nbsp; Did it multiple times.&nbsp; He could 
		not get through a Republican primary today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let's look at 
		Bowles-Simpson.&nbsp; Essentially, my differences with Bowles-Simpson were I 
		actually proposed less revenue and slightly lower defense spending 
		cuts.&nbsp; The Republicans want to increase defense spending and take in no 
		revenue, which makes it impossible to balance the deficit under the 
		terms that Bowles-Simpson laid out -- unless you essentially eliminate 
		discretionary spending.&nbsp; You don't just cut discretionary spending.&nbsp; 
		Everything we think of as being pretty important -- from education to 
		basic science and research to transportation spending to national parks 
		to environmental protection -- we'd essentially have to eliminate.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I guess another way of 
		thinking about this is -- and this bears on your reporting.&nbsp; I think 
		that there is oftentimes the impulse to suggest that if the two parties 
		are disagreeing, then they're equally at fault and the truth lies 
		somewhere in the middle, and an equivalence is presented -- which 
		reinforces I think people's cynicism about Washington generally.&nbsp; This 
		is not one of those situations where there's an equivalence.&nbsp; I've got 
		some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress who were prepared to make 
		significant changes to entitlements that go against their political 
		interests, and who said they were willing to do it.&nbsp; And we couldn't get 
		a Republican to stand up and say, we'll raise some revenue, or even to 
		suggest that we won't give more tax cuts to people who don't need them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so I think it's 
		important to put the current debate in some historical context.&nbsp; It's 
		not just true, by the way, of the budget.&nbsp; It's true of a lot of the 
		debates that we're having out here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cap and trade was originally 
		proposed by conservatives and Republicans as a market-based solution to 
		solving environmental problems.&nbsp; The first President to talk about cap 
		and trade was George H.W. Bush.&nbsp; Now you've got the other party 
		essentially saying we shouldn’t even be thinking about environmental 
		protection; let's gut the EPA.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Health care, which is in the 
		news right now -- there's a reason why there's a little bit of confusion 
		in the Republican primary about health care and the individual mandate 
		since it originated as a conservative idea to preserve the private 
		marketplace in health care while still assuring that everybody got 
		covered, in contrast to a single-payer plan.&nbsp; Now, suddenly, this is 
		some socialist overreach.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So as all of you are doing 
		your reporting, I think it's important to remember that the positions 
		I'm taking now on the budget and a host of other issues, if we had been 
		having this discussion 20 years ago, or even 15 years ago, would have 
		been considered squarely centrist positions.&nbsp; What's changed is the 
		center of the Republican Party.&nbsp; And that’s certainly true with the 
		budget.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">MR. SINGLETON:&nbsp; Mr. 
		President, the managing director of the [inaudible] for continuation of 
		United States leadership [inaudible] economic issues, and underscored 
		the need for a lower deficit and lower debt.&nbsp; How can you respond to 
		that claim?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, look, 
		she's absolutely right.&nbsp; It's interesting, when I travel around the 
		world at these international fora -- and I've said this before -- the 
		degree to which America is still the one indispensable nation, the 
		degree to which, even as other countries are rising and their economies 
		are expanding, we are still looked to for leadership, for agenda setting 
		-- not just because of our size, not just because of our military power, 
		but because there is a sense that unlike most superpowers in the past, 
		we try to set out a set of universal rules, a set of principles by which 
		everybody can benefit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s true on the 
		economic front as well.&nbsp; We continue to be the world’s largest market, 
		an important engine for economic growth.&nbsp; We can’t return to a time when 
		by simply borrowing and consuming, we end up driving global economic 
		growth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I said this a few months 
		after I was elected at the first G20 summit.&nbsp; I said the days when 
		Americans using their credit cards and home equity loans finance the 
		rest of the world’s growth by taking in imports from every place else -- 
		those days are over.&nbsp; On the other hand, we continue to be a 
		extraordinarily important market and foundation for global economic 
		growth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We do have to take care of 
		our deficits.&nbsp; I think Christine has spoken before, and I think most 
		economists would argue as well, that the challenge when it comes to our 
		deficits is not short-term discretionary spending, which is manageable.&nbsp; 
		As I said before and I want to repeat, as a percentage of our GDP, our 
		discretionary spending -- all the things that the Republicans are 
		proposing cutting -- is actually lower than it's been since Dwight 
		Eisenhower.&nbsp; There has not been some massive expansion of social 
		programs, programs that help the poor, environmental programs, education 
		programs.&nbsp; That’s not our problem.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our problem is that our 
		revenue has dropped down to between 15 and 16 percent -- far lower than 
		it has been historically, certainly far lower than it was under Ronald 
		Reagan -- at the same time as our health care costs have surged, and our 
		demographics mean that there is more and more pressure being placed on 
		financing our Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So at a time when the 
		recovery is still gaining steam, and unemployment is still very high, 
		the solution should be pretty apparent.&nbsp; And that is even as we continue 
		to make investments in growth today -- for example, putting some of our 
		construction workers back to work rebuilding schools and roads and 
		bridges, or helping states to rehire teachers at a time when schools are 
		having a huge difficulty retaining quality teachers in the classroom -- 
		all of which would benefit our economy, we focus on a long-term plan to 
		stabilize our revenues at a responsible level and to deal with our 
		health care programs in a responsible way.&nbsp; And that's exactly what I'm 
		proposing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And what we've proposed is 
		let's go back, for folks who are making more than $250,000 a year, to 
		levels that were in place during the Clinton era, when wealthy people 
		were doing just fine, and the economy was growing a lot stronger than it 
		did after they were cut.&nbsp; And let's take on Medicare and Medicaid in a 
		serious way -- which is not just a matter of taking those costs off the 
		books, off the federal books, and pushing them onto individual seniors, 
		but let's actually reduce health care costs.&nbsp; Because we spend more on 
		health care with not as good outcomes as any other advanced, developed 
		nation on Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that would seem to be a 
		sensible proposal.&nbsp; The problem right now is not the technical means to 
		solve it.&nbsp; The problem is our politics.&nbsp; And that's part of what this 
		election and what this debate will need to be about, is, are we, as a 
		country, willing to get back to common-sense, balanced, fair solutions 
		that encourage our long-term economic growth and stabilize our budget.&nbsp; 
		And it can be done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One last point I want to 
		make, Dean, that I think is important, because it goes to the growth 
		issue.&nbsp; If state and local government hiring were basically on par to 
		what our current recovery -- on par to past recoveries, the unemployment 
		rate would probably be about a point lower than it is right now.&nbsp; If the 
		construction industry were going through what we normally go through, 
		that would be another point lower.&nbsp; The challenge we have right now -- 
		part of the challenge we have in terms of growth has to do with the very 
		specific issues of huge cuts in state and local government, and the 
		housing market still recovering from this massive bubble.&nbsp; And that -- 
		those two things are huge headwinds in terms of growth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I say this because if we, 
		for example, put some of those construction workers back to work, or we 
		put some of those teachers back in the classroom, that could actually 
		help create the kind of virtuous cycle that would bring in more revenues 
		just because of economic growth, would benefit the private sector in 
		significant ways.&nbsp; And that could help contribute to deficit reduction 
		in the short term, even as we still have to do these important changes 
		to our health care programs over the long term.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">MR. SINGLETON:&nbsp; Mr. 
		President, you said yesterday that it would be unprecedented for a 
		Supreme Court to overturn laws passed by an elected Congress.&nbsp; But that 
		is exactly what the Court has done during its entire existence.&nbsp; If the 
		Court were to overturn individual mandate, what would you do, or propose 
		to do, for the 30 million people who wouldn’t have health care after 
		that ruling?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, first 
		of all, let me be very specific. We have not seen a Court overturn a law 
		that was passed by Congress on a economic issue, like health care, that 
		I think most people would clearly consider commerce -- a law like that 
		has not been overturned at least since Lochner.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; So we’re going 
		back to the ’30s, pre New Deal.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the point I was making 
		is that the Supreme Court is the final say on our Constitution and our 
		laws, and all of us have to respect it, but it’s precisely because of 
		that extraordinary power that the Court has traditionally exercised 
		significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature, our 
		Congress.&nbsp; And so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like 
		this.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, as I said, I expect the 
		Supreme Court actually to recognize that and to abide by 
		well-established precedence out there.&nbsp; I have enormous confidence that 
		in looking at this law, not only is it constitutional, but that the 
		Court is going to exercise its jurisprudence carefully because of the 
		profound power that our Supreme Court has.&nbsp; As a consequence, we’re not 
		spending a whole bunch of time planning for contingencies.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What I did emphasize 
		yesterday is there is a human element to this that everybody has to 
		remember.&nbsp; This is not an abstract exercise.&nbsp; I get letters every day 
		from people who are affected by the health care law right now, even 
		though it’s not fully implemented.&nbsp; Young people who are 24, 25, who 
		say, you know what, I just got diagnosed with a tumor.&nbsp; First of all, I 
		would not have gone to get a check-up if I hadn’t had health insurance. 
		Second of all, I wouldn’t have been able to afford to get it treated had 
		I not been on my parent’s plan.&nbsp; Thank you and thank Congress for 
		getting this done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I get letters from folks who 
		have just lost their job, their COBRA is running out.&nbsp; They’re in the 
		middle of treatment for colon cancer or breast cancer, and they’re 
		worried when their COBRA runs out, if they’re still sick, what are they 
		going to be able to do because they’re not going to be able to get 
		health insurance.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the point I think that 
		was made very ably before the Supreme Court, but I think most health 
		care economists who have looked at this have acknowledged, is there are 
		basically two ways to cover people with preexisting conditions or assure 
		that people can always get coverage even when they had bad illnesses.&nbsp; 
		One way is the single-payer plan -- everybody is under a single system, 
		like Medicare.&nbsp; The other way is to set up a system in which you don’t 
		have people who are healthy but don’t bother to get health insurance, 
		and then we all have to pay for them in the emergency room.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That doesn’t work, and so, 
		as a consequence, we've got to make sure that those folks are taking

		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I don’t anticipate the 
		Court striking this down.&nbsp; I think they take their responsibilities very 
		seriously.&nbsp; But I think what's more important is for all of us, 
		Democrats and Republicans, to recognize that in a country like ours -- 
		the wealthiest, most powerful country on Earth -- we shouldn’t have a 
		system in which millions of people are at risk of bankruptcy because 
		they get sick, or end up waiting until they do get sick and then go to 
		the emergency room, which involves all of us paying for it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">MR. SINGLETON:&nbsp; Mr. 
		President, you've been very, very generous with your time, and we 
		appreciate very much you being here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you so 
		much, everybody.&nbsp; Thank you.</font></p>
