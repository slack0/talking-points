<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All right.&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; 
		In a few moments, I’ll be joining members of our armed forces, their 
		families, and veterans for the Memorial Day observance at Arlington.&nbsp; 
		There, and across our nation, we’ll pause to honor all those who’ve 
		given their last full measure of devotion in defense of our country.&nbsp; 
		Theirs was the ultimate sacrifice, but it is one that every man and 
		woman who wears America’s uniform is prepared to make -- so that we can 
		live free.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The men and women of our 
		armed forces are the best our nation has to offer, and they deserve 
		nothing but the absolute best in return.&nbsp; And that includes leaders who 
		will guide them, and support their families, with wisdom and strength 
		and compassion.&nbsp; And that’s what I expect as Commander-in-Chief as we 
		work to keep our nation secure and our military the finest in the world.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		I found those qualities in Leon Panetta, who I announced last month as 
		my choice to succeed our outstanding Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates, 
		who I thank for joining us today.&nbsp; And I found these qualities in the 
		leaders who will complete our team at the Pentagon and whom I’m proud to 
		announce today -- General Martin Dempsey as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
		of Staff, Admiral James Winnefeld as the Vice Chairman, and to succeed 
		General Dempsey as Chief of Staff of the Army, General Ray Odierno.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Chairman of the Joint 
		Chiefs of Staff is the principal military advisor to me and my national 
		security team, including the Secretary of Defense.&nbsp; Since taking office, 
		I’ve been very grateful for the leadership of the current Chairman, 
		Admiral Mike Mullen, and the Vice Chairman, General Jim “Hoss” 
		Cartwright.&nbsp; These two men have served our nation with distinction for 
		decades, and I look forward to paying tribute to their lives of service 
		in the months ahead.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, I’ll simply say that, 
		like President Bush before me, I’ve deeply valued Mike’s professional 
		steadiness and his personal integrity.&nbsp; On his watch, our military 
		forces have excelled across the whole spectrum of missions, from combat 
		in Iraq and Afghanistan to relief efforts after the Haiti earthquake.&nbsp; 
		He’s helped revitalize NATO, reset our relations with Russia, and steer 
		our relationship with Pakistan and China.&nbsp; And I believe that history 
		will also record Mike Mullen as the Chairman who said what he believed 
		was right and declared that no one in uniform should ever have to 
		sacrifice their integrity to serve their country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ve also benefited 
		enormously from the advice and counsel of Hoss Cartwright.&nbsp; Hoss is that 
		rare combination of technical expert -- from cyber to missile defense -- 
		and strategic thinker, whether it was updating our nuclear posture or 
		preparing our military for 21st-century missions.&nbsp; I’ll always be 
		personally grateful to Hoss for his friendship and partnership.&nbsp; And as 
		he concludes four decades of service in the Marine Corps that he loves, 
		he can do so knowing that our nation is more secure, and our military is 
		stronger, because of his remarkable career.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I know that Michelle 
		joins me in saluting Deborah Mullen and Sandee Cartwright for their 
		decades of extraordinary service, especially as champions of our 
		inspiring military families.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With the advice and consent 
		of the Senate, it is our hope and expectation that Leon Panetta will 
		soon take the reigns as Secretary of Defense.&nbsp; General Cartwright’s term 
		ends this summer; Admiral Mullen’s term ends this fall.&nbsp; I’m announcing 
		my choice for their successors today because it’s essential that this 
		transition be seamless and that we stay focused on the urgent national 
		security challenges before us.&nbsp; And I want to thank Deputy Secretary of 
		Defense Bill Lynn for the continuity that he’ll provide during this 
		transition.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With nearly 40 years in 
		uniform, Martin Dempsey is one of our nation’s most respected -- and 
		combat-tested --generals.&nbsp; In Iraq, he led our soldiers against a brutal 
		insurgency.&nbsp; Having trained Iraqi forces, he knows that nations must 
		ultimately take responsibility for their own security.&nbsp; Having served as 
		acting commander of Central Command, he understands that in Iraq and 
		Afghanistan security gains and political progress must go hand in hand.&nbsp; 
		And just as he challenged the Army to embrace new doctrine and tactics, 
		I expect him to push all our forces to continue adapting and innovating 
		to be ready for the missions of today and tomorrow.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I was proud to nominate 
		Marty as Army Chief of Staff, and I realized he only assumed that 
		position last month.&nbsp; Marty, your tenure as Chief may go down as one of 
		the shortest in Army history.&nbsp; But it’s your lifetime of accomplishment 
		that brings us here today.&nbsp; And I thank you for your willingness to take 
		on this new assignment, along with your wife Deanie and your three 
		children, all of whom have served in the Army.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, I want every one of 
		our men and women in uniform to hear the words that you spoke to your 
		soldiers on your first day as Chief, because it’s our shared message to 
		all who serve, especially our troops in harm’s way:&nbsp; “We will provide 
		whatever it takes to achieve our objectives in the current fight.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Vice Chairman, Admiral 
		Sandy Winnefeld will draw on more than 30 years of distinguished 
		service.&nbsp; Under his command, fighters from the aircraft carrier USS 
		Enterprise pounded Taliban positions in the weeks after 9/11 and his 
		carrier strike group played a critical role in air operations over 
		Iraq.&nbsp; Having served as a NATO commander, Sandy is well known to our 
		allies.&nbsp; Having served on the Joint Staff, he is known and trusted here 
		at the White House.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most recently, as head of 
		Northern Command, Sandy’s been responsible for the defense of our 
		homeland and support to states and communities in times of crisis, such 
		as the recent tornadoes and the floods along the Mississippi.&nbsp; He’s 
		supported our Mexican partners in their fight against the cartels and 
		our Japanese allies in the response to their nuclear emergency.&nbsp; So 
		Sandy knows that we have to be prepared for the full range of 
		challenges.&nbsp; Sandy, I thank you and your wife Mary and your two sons for 
		your continued service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ve selected General 
		Dempsey and Admiral Winnefeld because of their record -- and potential 
		-- as individuals.&nbsp; But I’ve also selected them because they will make 
		an extraordinary team -- despite their competing loyalties to Army and 
		Navy.&nbsp; Between them, they bring deep experience in virtually every 
		domain -- land, air, space, sea, cyber.&nbsp; Both of them have the respect 
		and the trust of our troops on the frontlines, our friends in Congress, 
		and allies and partners abroad.&nbsp; And both of them have my full 
		confidence.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They both have something 
		else.&nbsp; For the first time, the Chairman and Vice Chairman will have the 
		experience of leading combat operations in the years since 9/11.&nbsp; Two 
		moments in particular speak to this leadership.&nbsp; On the morning of 
		September 11, 2001, the Enterprise was returning home from the Persian 
		Gulf when word came of the attacks.&nbsp; Rather than wait for orders, Sandy 
		took the initiative, reversed course, and put his ship and aircraft 
		within range of Afghanistan by the next morning, setting the stage for 
		the strikes that followed.&nbsp; A few years later, as Marty’s 1st Armored 
		Division was rotating out of Iraq, he suddenly got new orders.&nbsp; He 
		turned his division around, shifted to new parts of Iraq, and defeated 
		an insurgent uprising -- a remarkable maneuver that has entered the 
		annals of Army history.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And while I know that folks 
		across the Army are proud to see one of their own selected as Chairman, 
		I also know this means losing their new Chief in a time of war.&nbsp; And 
		that’s why, for the next Army Chief of Staff, I’m nominating one of the 
		Army’s most accomplished soldiers -- and one of the tallest -- 
		General Ray Odierno.&nbsp; In three pivotal deployments to 
		Iraq, he commanded the troops that captured Saddam Hussein, partnered 
		with General Petraeus to help bring down the violence, and then 
		transferred responsibility to Iraqi forces, allowing us to remove some 
		100,000 American troops and end our combat mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">After years on the 
		frontlines, Ray understands what the Army must do -- to prevail in 
		today’s wars, to prepare for the future, and to preserve the readiness 
		of the soldiers and families who are the strength of America’s 
		families.&nbsp; And we’re fortunate that Ray’s dedication to our soldiers is 
		shared by his wife Linda and their family, including their son Tony, a 
		combat veteran and advocate for his fellow wounded warriors.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I urge our friends in the 
		Senate to confirm these outstanding individuals as swiftly as possible.&nbsp; 
		They’re innovative, flexible, focused on the future, and deeply devoted 
		to our troops and their families.&nbsp; General Dempsey, Admiral Winnefeld, 
		we have much to do -- from bringing our troops home from Iraq to 
		beginning to reduce our forces in Afghanistan this summer and 
		transitioning to Afghan lead; from defeating al Qaeda to protecting the 
		Libyan people.&nbsp; All this, even as we make difficult budget decisions 
		while keeping our military the finest fighting force in the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Above all, as 
		Commander-in-Chief, I’ll be looking to you, and the rest of the Joint 
		Chiefs, for what I value most in my advisors -- your honest, unvarnished 
		advice, and the full range of options, especially when it comes to our 
		most solemn obligation:&nbsp; protecting the lives of our brave men and women 
		in uniform.&nbsp; We have no greater responsibility, as we are reminded today 
		when we honor all those who sacrificed so that we can enjoy the 
		blessings of freedom.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, again, to Marty, Sandy, 
		and Ray, as well as your families, thank you for your patriotic service 
		and your readiness to lead once more.&nbsp; Thank you very much, everybody.</font></p>
