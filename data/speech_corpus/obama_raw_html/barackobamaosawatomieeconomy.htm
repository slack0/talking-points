CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good 
		afternoon, everybody.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, I want to start by 
		thanking a few folks who’ve joined us today. We’ve got the mayor of 
		Osawatomie, Phil Dudley is here. We have your superintendent Gary French 
		in the house. And we have the principal of Osawatomie High, Doug Chisam. 
		And I have brought your former governor, who is doing now an outstanding 
		job as Secretary of Health and Human Services -- 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Sebelius">
		<font color="#0000FF">Kathleen Sebelius</font></a> is in 
		the house. We love Kathleen.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, it is great to be back 
		in the state of Tex -- state of Kansas. I was giving 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Self"><font color="#0000FF">Bill Self</font></a> a hard 
		time, he was here a while back. As many of you know, I have roots here. 
		I’m sure you’re all familiar with the Obamas of Osawatomie. Actually, I 
		like to say that I got my name from my father, but I got my accent -- 
		and my values -- from my mother. She was born in Wichita. Her mother 
		grew up in Augusta. Her father was from El Dorado. So my Kansas roots 
		run deep.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My grandparents served 
		during World War II. He was a soldier in Patton’s Army; she was a worker 
		on a bomber assembly line. And together, they shared the optimism of a 
		nation that triumphed over the Great Depression and over fascism. They 
		believed in an America where hard work paid off, and responsibility was 
		rewarded, and anyone could make it if they tried -- no matter who you 
		were, no matter where you came from, no matter how you started out.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And these values gave rise 
		to the largest middle class and the strongest economy that the world has 
		ever known. It was here in America that the most productive workers, the 
		most innovative companies turned out the best products on Earth. And you 
		know what? Every American shared in that pride and in that success -- 
		from those in the executive suites to those in middle management to 
		those on the factory floor. So you could have some confidence that if 
		you gave it your all, you’d take enough home to raise your family and 
		send your kids to school and have your health care covered, put a little 
		away for retirement.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, we’re still home to 
		the world’s most productive workers. We’re still home to the world’s 
		most innovative companies. But for most Americans, the basic bargain 
		that made this country great has eroded. Long before the recession hit, 
		hard work stopped paying off for too many people. Fewer and fewer of the 
		folks who contributed to the success of our economy actually benefited 
		from that success. Those at the very top grew wealthier from their 
		incomes and their investments -- wealthier than ever before. But 
		everybody else struggled with costs that were growing and paychecks that 
		weren’t -- and too many families found themselves racking up more and 
		more debt just to keep up.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, for many years, credit 
		cards and home equity loans papered over this harsh reality. But in 
		2008, the house of cards collapsed. We all know the story by now: 
		Mortgages sold to people who couldn’t afford them, or even sometimes 
		understand them. Banks and investors allowed to keep packaging the risk 
		and selling it off. Huge bets -- and huge bonuses -- made with other 
		people’s money on the line. Regulators who were supposed to warn us 
		about the dangers of all this, but looked the other way or didn’t have 
		the authority to look at all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was wrong. It combined 
		the breathtaking greed of a few with irresponsibility all across the 
		system. And it plunged our economy and the world into a crisis from 
		which we’re still fighting to recover. It claimed the jobs and the homes 
		and the basic security of millions of people -- innocent, hardworking 
		Americans who had met their responsibilities but were still left holding 
		the bag.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And ever since, there’s been 
		a raging debate over the best way to restore growth and prosperity, 
		restore balance, restore fairness. Throughout the country, it’s sparked 
		protests and political movements -- from the tea party to the people 
		who’ve been occupying the streets of New York and other cities. It’s 
		left Washington in a near-constant state of gridlock. It’s been the 
		topic of heated and sometimes colorful discussion among the men and 
		women running for president.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But, Osawatomie, this is not 
		just another political debate. This is the defining issue of our time. 
		This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and for all those 
		who are fighting to get into the middle class. Because what’s at stake 
		is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough 
		to raise a family, build a modest savings, own a home, secure their 
		retirement.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Now, in the midst of this debate, there are some who seem to be 
		suffering from a kind of collective amnesia. After all that’s happened, 
		after the worst economic crisis, the worst financial crisis since the 
		Great Depression, they want to return to the same practices that got us 
		into this mess. In fact, they want to go back to the same policies that 
		stacked the deck against middle-class Americans for way too many years. 
		And their philosophy is simple: We are better off when everybody is left 
		to fend for themselves and play by their own rules.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am here to say they are 
		wrong. I’m here in Kansas to reaffirm my deep conviction that we’re 
		greater together than we are on our own. I believe that this country 
		succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair 
		share, when everyone plays by the same rules. These aren’t Democratic 
		values or Republican values. These aren’t 1 percent values or 99 percent 
		values. They’re American values. And we have to reclaim them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You see, this isn’t the 
		first time America has faced this choice. At the turn of the last 
		century, when a nation of farmers was transitioning to become the 
		world’s industrial giant, we had to decide: Would we settle for a 
		country where most of the new railroads and factories were being 
		controlled by a few giant monopolies that kept prices high and wages 
		low? Would we allow our citizens and even our children to work ungodly 
		hours in conditions that were unsafe and unsanitary? Would we restrict 
		education to the privileged few? Because there were people who thought 
		massive inequality and exploitation of people was just the price you pay 
		for progress.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Nationalism">
		<font color="#0000FF">Theodore Roosevelt disagreed</font></a>. He was 
		the Republican son of a wealthy family. He praised what the titans of 
		industry had done to create jobs and grow the economy. He believed then 
		what we know is true today, that the free market is the greatest force 
		for economic progress in human history. It’s led to a prosperity and a 
		standard of living unmatched by the rest of the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But Roosevelt also knew that 
		the free market has never been a free license to take whatever you can 
		from whomever you can. He understood the free market only works when 
		there are rules of the road that ensure competition is fair and open and 
		honest. And so he busted up monopolies, forcing those companies to 
		compete for consumers with better services and better prices. And today, 
		they still must. He fought to make sure businesses couldn’t profit by 
		exploiting children or selling food or medicine that wasn’t safe. And 
		today, they still can’t.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And in 1910,
		<a href="http://www.presidentialrhetoric.com/historicspeeches/roosevelt_theodore/newnationalism.html">
		<font color="#0000FF">Teddy Roosevelt came here to Osawatomie</font></a> 
		and he laid out his vision for what he called a New Nationalism. “Our 
		country,” he said, “…means nothing unless it means the triumph of a real 
		democracy…of an economic system under which each man shall be guaranteed 
		the opportunity to show the best that there is in him.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, for this, Roosevelt was 
		called a radical. He was called a socialist -- even a communist. But 
		today, we are a richer nation and a stronger democracy because of what 
		he fought for in his last campaign: an eight-hour work day and a minimum 
		wage for women -- insurance for the unemployed and for the elderly, and 
		those with disabilities; political reform and a progressive income tax.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, over 100 years later, 
		our economy has gone through another transformation. Over the last few 
		decades, huge advances in technology have allowed businesses to do more 
		with less, and it’s made it easier for them to set up shop and hire 
		workers anywhere they want in the world. And many of you know firsthand 
		the painful disruptions this has caused for a lot of Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Factories where people 
		thought they would retire suddenly picked up and went overseas, where 
		workers were cheaper. Steel mills that needed 100 -- or 1,000 employees 
		are now able to do the same work with 100 employees, so layoffs too 
		often became permanent, not just a temporary part of the business cycle. 
		And these changes didn’t just affect blue-collar workers. If you were a 
		bank teller or a phone operator or a travel agent, you saw many in your 
		profession replaced by ATMs and the Internet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, even higher-skilled 
		jobs, like accountants and middle management can be outsourced to 
		countries like China or India. And if you’re somebody whose job can be 
		done cheaper by a computer or someone in another country, you don’t have 
		a lot of leverage with your employer when it comes to asking for better 
		wages or better benefits, especially since fewer Americans today are 
		part of a union.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, just as there was in 
		Teddy Roosevelt’s time, there is a certain crowd in Washington who, for 
		the last few decades, have said, let’s respond to this economic 
		challenge with the same old tune. “The market will take care of 
		everything,” they tell us. If we just cut more regulations and cut more 
		taxes -- especially for the wealthy -- our economy will grow stronger. 
		Sure, they say, there will be winners and losers. But if the winners do 
		really well, then jobs and prosperity will eventually trickle down to 
		everybody else. And, they argue, even if prosperity doesn’t trickle 
		down, well, that’s the price of liberty.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, it’s a simple theory. 
		And we have to admit, it’s one that speaks to our rugged individualism 
		and our healthy skepticism of too much government. That’s in America’s 
		DNA. And that theory fits well on a bumper sticker. But here’s the 
		problem: It doesn’t work. It has never worked. It didn’t work when it 
		was tried in the decade before the Great Depression. It’s not what led 
		to the incredible postwar booms of the ‘50s and ‘60s. And it didn’t work 
		when we tried it during the last decade. I mean, understand, it’s not as 
		if we haven’t tried this theory.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Remember in those years, in 
		2001 and 2003, Congress passed two of the most expensive tax cuts for 
		the wealthy in history. And what did it get us? The slowest job growth 
		in half a century. Massive deficits that have made it much harder to pay 
		for the investments that built this country and provided the basic 
		security that helped millions of Americans reach and stay in the middle 
		class -- things like education and infrastructure, science and 
		technology, Medicare and Social Security.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Remember that in those same 
		years, thanks to some of the same folks who are now running Congress, we 
		had weak regulation, we had little oversight, and what did it get us? 
		Insurance companies that jacked up people’s premiums with impunity and 
		denied care to patients who were sick, mortgage lenders that tricked 
		families into buying homes they couldn’t afford, a financial sector 
		where irresponsibility and lack of basic oversight nearly destroyed our 
		entire economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We simply cannot return to 
		this brand of “you’re on your own” economics if we’re serious about 
		rebuilding the middle class in this country. We know that it doesn’t 
		result in a strong economy. It results in an economy that invests too 
		little in its people and in its future. We know it doesn’t result in a 
		prosperity that trickles down. It results in a prosperity that’s enjoyed 
		by fewer and fewer of our citizens.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Look at the statistics. In 
		the last few decades, the average income of the top 1 percent has gone 
		up by more than 250 percent to 1.2 million dollars per year. I’m not 
		talking about millionaires, people who have a million dollars. I’m 
		saying people who make a million dollars every single year. For the top 
		one hundredth of 1 percent, the average income is now 27 million dollars 
		per year. The typical CEO who used to earn about 30 times more than his 
		or her worker now earns 110 times more. And yet, over the last decade 
		the incomes of most Americans have actually fallen by about 6 percent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this kind of inequality 
		-- a level that we haven’t seen since the Great Depression -- hurts us 
		all. When middle-class families can no longer afford to buy the goods 
		and services that businesses are selling, when people are slipping out 
		of the middle class, it drags down the entire economy from top to 
		bottom. America was built on the idea of broad-based prosperity, of 
		strong consumers all across the country. That’s why a CEO like Henry 
		Ford made it his mission to pay his workers enough so that they could 
		buy the cars he made. It’s also why a recent study showed that countries 
		with less inequality tend to have stronger and steadier economic growth 
		over the long run.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Inequality also distorts our 
		democracy. It gives an outsized voice to the few who can afford 
		high-priced lobbyists and unlimited campaign contributions, and it runs 
		the risk of selling out our democracy to the highest bidder. It leaves 
		everyone else rightly suspicious that the system in Washington is rigged 
		against them, that our elected representatives aren’t looking out for 
		the interests of most Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there’s an even more 
		fundamental issue at stake. This kind of gaping inequality gives lie to 
		the promise that’s at the very heart of America: that this is a place 
		where you can make it if you try. We tell people -- we tell our kids -- 
		that in this country, even if you’re born with nothing, work hard and 
		you can get into the middle class. We tell them that your children will 
		have a chance to do even better than you do. That’s why immigrants from 
		around the world historically have flocked to our shores.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, over the last few 
		decades, the rungs on the ladder of opportunity have grown farther and 
		farther apart, and the middle class has shrunk. You know, a few years 
		after World War II, a child who was born into poverty had a slightly 
		better than 50-50 chance of becoming middle class as an adult. By 1980, 
		that chance had fallen to around 40 percent. And if the trend of rising 
		inequality over the last few decades continues, it’s estimated that a 
		child born today will only have a one-in-three chance of making it to 
		the middle class -- 33 percent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s heartbreaking enough 
		that there are millions of working families in this country who are now 
		forced to take their children to food banks for a decent meal. But the 
		idea that those children might not have a chance to climb out of that 
		situation and back into the middle class, no matter how hard they work? 
		That’s inexcusable. It is wrong. It flies in the face of everything that 
		we stand for.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, fortunately, that’s not 
		a future that we have to accept, because there’s another view about how 
		we build a strong middle class in this country -- a view that’s truer to 
		our history, a vision that’s been embraced in the past by people of both 
		parties for more than 200 years.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		It’s not a view that we should somehow turn back technology or put up 
		walls around America. It’s not a view that says we should punish profit 
		or success or pretend that government knows how to fix all of society’s 
		problems. It is a view that says in America we are greater together -- 
		when everyone engages in fair play and everybody gets a fair shot and 
		everybody does their fair share.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what does that mean for 
		restoring middle-class security in today’s economy? Well, it starts by 
		making sure that everyone in America gets a fair shot at success. The 
		truth is we’ll never be able to compete with other countries when it 
		comes to who’s best at letting their businesses pay the lowest wages, 
		who’s best at busting unions, who’s best at letting companies pollute as 
		much as they want. That’s a race to the bottom that we can’t win, and we 
		shouldn’t want to win that race. Those countries don’t have a strong 
		middle class. They don’t have our standard of living.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The race we want to win, the 
		race we can win is a race to the top -- the race for good jobs that pay 
		well and offer middle-class security. Businesses will create those jobs 
		in countries with the highest-skilled, highest-educated workers, the 
		most advanced transportation and communication, the strongest commitment 
		to research and technology.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The world is shifting to an 
		innovation economy and nobody does innovation better than America. 
		Nobody does it better. No one has better colleges. Nobody has better 
		universities. Nobody has a greater diversity of talent and ingenuity. No 
		one’s workers or entrepreneurs are more driven or more daring. The 
		things that have always been our strengths match up perfectly with the 
		demands of the moment.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we need to meet the 
		moment. We’ve got to up our game. We need to remember that we can only 
		do that together. It starts by making education a national mission -- a 
		national mission. Government and businesses, parents and citizens. In 
		this economy, a higher education is the surest route to the middle 
		class. The unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more 
		is about half the national average. And their incomes are twice as high 
		as those who don’t have a high school diploma. Which means we shouldn’t 
		be laying off good teachers right now -- we should be hiring them. We 
		shouldn’t be expecting less of our schools –- we should be demanding 
		more. We shouldn’t be making it harder to afford college -- we should be 
		a country where everyone has a chance to go and doesn’t rack up $100,000 
		of debt just because they went.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In today’s innovation 
		economy, we also need a world-class commitment to science and research, 
		the next generation of high-tech manufacturing. Our factories and our 
		workers shouldn’t be idle. We should be giving people the chance to get 
		new skills and training at community colleges so they can learn how to 
		make wind turbines and semiconductors and high-powered batteries. And by 
		the way, if we don’t have an economy that’s built on bubbles and 
		financial speculation, our best and brightest won’t all gravitate 
		towards careers in banking and finance. Because if we want an economy 
		that’s built to last, we need more of those young people in science and 
		engineering. This country should not be known for bad debt and phony 
		profits. We should be known for creating and selling products all around 
		the world that are stamped with three proud words: Made in America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, manufacturers and 
		other companies are setting up shop in the places with the best 
		infrastructure to ship their products, move their workers, communicate 
		with the rest of the world. And that’s why the over 1 million 
		construction workers who lost their jobs when the housing market 
		collapsed, they shouldn’t be sitting at home with nothing to do. They 
		should be rebuilding our roads and our bridges, laying down faster 
		railroads and broadband, modernizing our schools -- all the things other 
		countries are already doing to attract good jobs and businesses to their 
		shores.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, business, and not 
		government, will always be the primary generator of good jobs with 
		incomes that lift people into the middle class and keep them there. But 
		as a nation, we’ve always come together, through our government, to help 
		create the conditions where both workers and businesses can succeed. And 
		historically, that hasn’t been a partisan idea. Franklin Roosevelt 
		worked with Democrats and Republicans to give veterans of World War II 
		-- including my grandfather, Stanley Dunham -- the chance to go to 
		college on the G.I. Bill. It was a Republican President, Dwight 
		Eisenhower, a proud son of Kansas -- who started the Interstate Highway 
		System, and doubled down on science and research to stay ahead of the 
		Soviets.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, those productive 
		investments cost money. They’re not free. And so we’ve also paid for 
		these investments by asking everybody to do their fair share. Look, if 
		we had unlimited resources, no one would ever have to pay any taxes and 
		we would never have to cut any spending. But we don’t have unlimited 
		resources. And so we have to set priorities. If we want a strong middle 
		class, then our tax code must reflect our values. We have to make 
		choices.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today that choice is very 
		clear. To reduce our deficit, I’ve already signed nearly $1 trillion of 
		spending cuts into law and I’ve proposed trillions more, including 
		reforms that would lower the cost of Medicare and Medicaid.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But in order to structurally 
		close the deficit, get our fiscal house in order, we have to decide what 
		our priorities are. Now, most immediately, short term, we need to extend 
		a payroll tax cut that’s set to expire at the end of this month. If we 
		don’t do that, 160 million Americans, including most of the people here, 
		will see their taxes go up by an average of $1,000 starting in January 
		and it would badly weaken our recovery. That’s the short term.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the long term, we have to 
		rethink our tax system more fundamentally. We have to ask ourselves: Do 
		we want to make the investments we need in things like education and 
		research and high-tech manufacturing -- all those things that helped 
		make us an economic superpower? Or do we want to keep in place the tax 
		breaks for the wealthiest Americans in our country? Because we can’t 
		afford to do both. That is not politics. That’s just math.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, so far, most of my 
		Republican friends in Washington have refused under any circumstance to 
		ask the wealthiest Americans to go to the same tax rate they were paying 
		when Bill Clinton was president. So let’s just do a trip down memory 
		lane here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Keep in mind, when President 
		Clinton first proposed these tax increases, folks in Congress predicted 
		they would kill jobs and lead to another recession. Instead, our economy 
		created nearly 23 million jobs and we eliminated the deficit. Today, the 
		wealthiest Americans are paying the lowest taxes in over half a century. 
		This isn’t like in the early ‘50s, when the top tax rate was over 90 
		percent. This isn’t even like the early ‘80s, when the top tax rate was 
		about 70 percent. Under President Clinton, the top rate was only about 
		39 percent. Today, thanks to loopholes and shelters, a quarter of all 
		millionaires now pay lower tax rates than millions of you, millions of 
		middle-class families. Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 
		percent. One percent.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is the height of 
		unfairness. It is wrong. It’s wrong that in the United States of 
		America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker, maybe earns 
		$50,000 a year, should pay a higher tax rate than somebody raking in $50 
		million. It’s wrong for Warren Buffett’s secretary to pay a higher tax 
		rate than Warren Buffett. And by the way, Warren Buffett agrees with me. 
		So do most Americans -- Democrats, independents and Republicans. And I 
		know that many of our wealthiest citizens would agree to contribute a 
		little more if it meant reducing the deficit and strengthening the 
		economy that made their success possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This isn’t about class 
		warfare. This is about the nation’s welfare. It’s about making choices 
		that benefit not just the people who’ve done fantastically well over the 
		last few decades, but that benefits the middle class, and those fighting 
		to get into the middle class, and the economy as a whole.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, a strong middle 
		class can only exist in an economy where everyone plays by the same 
		rules, from Wall Street to Main Street. As infuriating as it was for all 
		of us, we rescued our major banks from collapse, not only because a 
		full-blown financial meltdown would have sent us into a second 
		Depression, but because we need a strong, healthy financial sector in 
		this country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But part of the deal was 
		that we wouldn’t go back to business as usual. And that’s why last year 
		we put in place new rules of the road that refocus the financial sector 
		on what should be their core purpose: getting capital to the 
		entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and financing millions of families 
		who want to buy a home or send their kids to college.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we’re not all the way 
		there yet, and the banks are fighting us every inch of the way. But 
		already, some of these reforms are being implemented.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you’re a big bank or 
		risky financial institution, you now have to write out a “living will” 
		that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you fail, so that 
		taxpayers are never again on the hook for Wall Street’s mistakes. There 
		are also limits on the size of banks and new abilities for regulators to 
		dismantle a firm that is going under. The new law bans banks from making 
		risky bets with their customers’ deposits, and it takes away big bonuses 
		and paydays from failed CEOs, while giving shareholders a say on 
		executive salaries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the law that we 
		passed. We are in the process of implementing it now. All of this is 
		being put in place as we speak. Now, unless you’re a financial 
		institution whose business model is built on breaking the law, cheating 
		consumers and making risky bets that could damage the entire economy, 
		you should have nothing to fear from these new rules.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of you may know, my 
		grandmother worked as a banker for most of her life -- worked her way 
		up, started as a secretary, ended up being a vice president of a bank. 
		And I know from her, and I know from all the people that I’ve come in 
		contact with, that the vast majority of bankers and financial service 
		professionals, they want to do right by their customers. They want to 
		have rules in place that don’t put them at a disadvantage for doing the 
		right thing. And yet, Republicans in Congress are fighting as hard as 
		they can to make sure that these rules aren’t enforced.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ll give you a specific 
		example. For the first time in history, the reforms that we passed put 
		in place a consumer watchdog who is charged with protecting everyday 
		Americans from being taken advantage of by mortgage lenders or payday 
		lenders or debt collectors. And the man we nominated for the post, 
		Richard Cordray, is a former attorney general of Ohio who has the 
		support of most attorney generals, both Democrat and Republican, 
		throughout the country. Nobody claims he’s not qualified.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the Republicans in the 
		Senate refuse to confirm him for the job; they refuse to let him do his 
		job. Why? Does anybody here think that the problem that led to our 
		financial crisis was too much oversight of mortgage lenders or debt 
		collectors?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course not. Every day we 
		go without a consumer watchdog is another day when a student, or a 
		senior citizen, or a member of our Armed Forces -- because they are very 
		vulnerable to some of this stuff -- could be tricked into a loan that 
		they can’t afford -- something that happens all the time. And the fact 
		is that financial institutions have plenty of lobbyists looking out for 
		their interests. Consumers deserve to have someone whose job it is to 
		look out for them. And I intend to make sure they do. And I want you to 
		hear me, Kansas: I will veto any effort to delay or defund or dismantle 
		the new rules that we put in place.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We shouldn’t be weakening 
		oversight and accountability. We should be strengthening oversight and 
		accountability. I’ll give you another example. Too often, we’ve seen 
		Wall Street firms violating major anti-fraud laws because the penalties 
		are too weak and there’s no price for being a repeat offender. No more. 
		I’ll be calling for legislation that makes those penalties count so that 
		firms don’t see punishment for breaking the law as just the price of 
		doing business.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The fact is this crisis has 
		left a huge deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street. And 
		major banks that were rescued by the taxpayers have an obligation to go 
		the extra mile in helping to close that deficit of trust. At minimum, 
		they should be remedying past mortgage abuses that led to the financial 
		crisis. They should be working to keep responsible homeowners in their 
		home. We’re going to keep pushing them to provide more time for 
		unemployed homeowners to look for work without having to worry about 
		immediately losing their house.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The big banks should 
		increase access to refinancing opportunities to borrowers who haven’t 
		yet benefited from historically low interest rates. And the big banks 
		should recognize that precisely because these steps are in the interest 
		of middle-class families and the broader economy, it will also be in the 
		banks’ own long-term financial interest. What will be good for consumers 
		over the long term will be good for the banks.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Investing in things like 
		education that give everybody a chance to succeed. A tax code that makes 
		sure everybody pays their fair share. And laws that make sure everybody 
		follows the rules. That’s what will transform our economy. That’s what 
		will grow our middle class again. In the end, rebuilding this economy 
		based on fair play, a fair shot, and a fair share will require all of us 
		to see that we have a stake in each other’s success. And it will require 
		all of us to take some responsibility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It will require parents to 
		get more involved in their children’s education. It will require 
		students to study harder. It will require some workers to start studying 
		all over again. It will require greater responsibility from homeowners 
		not to take out mortgages they can’t afford. They need to remember that 
		if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It will require those of us 
		in public service to make government more efficient and more effective, 
		more consumer-friendly, more responsive to people’s needs. That’s why 
		we’re cutting programs that we don’t need to pay for those we do. That’s 
		why we’ve made hundreds of regulatory reforms that will save businesses 
		billions of dollars. That’s why we’re not just throwing money at 
		education, we’re challenging schools to come up with the most innovative 
		reforms and the best results.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it will require American 
		business leaders to understand that their obligations don’t just end 
		with their shareholders. Andy Grove, the legendary former CEO of Intel, 
		put it best. He said, “There is another obligation I feel personally, 
		given that everything I’ve achieved in my career, and a lot of what 
		Intel has achieved…were made possible by a climate of democracy, an 
		economic climate and investment climate provided by the United States.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This broader obligation can 
		take many forms. At a time when the cost of hiring workers in China is 
		rising rapidly, it should mean more CEOs deciding that it’s time to 
		bring jobs back to the United States -- not just because it’s good for 
		business, but because it’s good for the country that made their business 
		and their personal success possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think about the Big Three 
		auto companies who, during recent negotiations, agreed to create more 
		jobs and cars here in America, and then decided to give bonuses not just 
		to their executives, but to all their employees, so that everyone was 
		invested in the company’s success.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think about a company 
		based in Warroad, Minnesota. It’s called Marvin Windows and Doors. 
		During the recession, Marvin’s competitors closed dozens of plants, let 
		hundreds of workers go. But Marvin’s did not lay off a single one of 
		their 4,000 or so employees -- not one. In fact, they’ve only laid off 
		workers once in over a hundred years. Mr. Marvin’s grandfather even kept 
		his eight employees during the Great Depression.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, at Marvin’s when times 
		get tough, the workers agree to give up some perks and some pay, and so 
		do the owners. As one owner said, “You can’t grow if you’re cutting your 
		lifeblood -- and that’s the skills and experience your workforce 
		delivers.” For the CEO of Marvin’s, it’s about the community. He said, 
		“These are people we went to school with. We go to church with them. We 
		see them in the same restaurants. Indeed, a lot of us have married local 
		girls and boys. We could be anywhere, but we are in Warroad.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s how America was 
		built. That’s why we’re the greatest nation on Earth. That’s what our 
		greatest companies understand. Our success has never just been about 
		survival of the fittest. It’s about building a nation where we’re all 
		better off. We pull together. We pitch in. We do our part. We believe 
		that hard work will pay off, that responsibility will be rewarded, and 
		that our children will inherit a nation where those values live on.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it is that belief that 
		rallied thousands of Americans to Osawatomie -- maybe even some of your 
		ancestors -- on a rain-soaked day more than a century ago. By train, by 
		wagon, on buggy, bicycle, on foot, they came to hear the vision of a man 
		who loved this country and was determined to perfect it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">“We are all Americans,” 
		Teddy Roosevelt told them that day. “Our common interests are as broad 
		as the continent.” In the final years of his life, Roosevelt took that 
		same message all across this country, from tiny Osawatomie to the heart 
		of New York City, believing that no matter where he went, no matter who 
		he was talking to, everybody would benefit from a country in which 
		everyone gets a fair chance.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And well into our third 
		century as a nation, we have grown and we’ve changed in many ways since 
		Roosevelt’s time. The world is faster and the playing field is larger 
		and the challenges are more complex. But what hasn’t changed -- what can 
		never change -- are the values that got us this far. We still have a 
		stake in each other’s success. We still believe that this should be a 
		place where you can make it if you try. And we still believe, in the 
		words of the man who called for a New Nationalism all those years ago, 
		“The fundamental rule of our national life,” he said, “the rule which 
		underlies all others -- is that, on the whole, and in the long run, we 
		shall go up or down together.” And I believe America is on the way up.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you. God bless you. 
		God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
