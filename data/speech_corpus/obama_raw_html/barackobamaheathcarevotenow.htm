&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much, all of 
		you, for joining us today.&nbsp; And I want to thank Julie, Barbara, Roland, 
		Stephen, Renee, and Christopher, standing behind me -- physicians, 
		physicians assistants, and nurses who understand how important it is for 
		us to make much needed changes in our health care system.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank all of you 
		who are here today.&nbsp; I want to specially recognize two people who have 
		been working tirelessly on that -- on this effort, my Secretary of 
		Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius -- as well as 
		our quarterback for health reform out of the White House, Nancy-Ann DeParle.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We began our push to reform 
		health insurance last March, in this room, with doctors and nurses who 
		know the system best.&nbsp; And so it’s fitting to be joined by all of you as 
		we bring this journey to a close.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last Thursday, I spent seven 
		hours at a summit where Democrats and Republicans engaged in a public 
		and very substantive discussion about health care.&nbsp; This meeting capped 
		off a debate that began with a similar summit nearly one year ago.&nbsp; And 
		since then, every idea has been put on the table.&nbsp; Every argument has 
		been made.&nbsp; Everything there is to say about health care has been said 
		-- and just about everybody has said it.&nbsp; So 
		now is the time to make a decision about how to finally reform health 
		care so that it works, not just for the insurance companies, but for 
		America’s families and America’s businesses.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, where both sides say 
		they agree is that the status quo is not working for the American 
		people.&nbsp; Health insurance is becoming more expensive by the day.&nbsp; 
		Families can’t afford it.&nbsp; Businesses can’t afford it.&nbsp; The federal 
		government can’t afford it.&nbsp; Smaller businesses and individuals who 
		don’t get coverage at work are squeezed especially hard.&nbsp; And insurance 
		companies freely ration health care based on who’s sick and who’s 
		healthy; who can pay and who can’t.&nbsp; That's the status quo.&nbsp; That's the 
		system we have right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Democrats and Republicans 
		agree that this is a serious problem for America.&nbsp; And we agree that if 
		we do nothing -- if we throw up our hands and walk away -- it’s a 
		problem that will only grow worse.&nbsp; Nobody disputes that.&nbsp; More 
		Americans will lose their family's health insurance if they switch jobs 
		or lose their job.&nbsp; More small businesses will be forced to choose 
		between health care and hiring.&nbsp; More insurance companies will deny 
		people coverage who have preexisting conditions, or they'll drop 
		people's coverage when they get sick and need it most.&nbsp; And the rising 
		cost of Medicare and Medicaid will sink our government deeper and deeper 
		and deeper into debt.&nbsp; On all of this we agree.&nbsp;So the question is, what do we do about it?&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On one end of the spectrum, 
		there are some who've suggested scrapping our system of private 
		insurance and replacing it with a government-run health care system.&nbsp; 
		And though many other countries have such a system, in America it would 
		be neither practical nor realistic.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other end of the 
		spectrum, there are those, and this includes most Republicans in 
		Congress, who believe the answer is to loosen regulations on the 
		insurance industry -- whether it's state consumer protections or minimum 
		standards for the kind of insurance they can sell.&nbsp; The argument is, is 
		that that will somehow lower costs.&nbsp; I disagree with that approach.&nbsp; I'm 
		concerned that this would only give the insurance industry even freer 
		rein to raise premiums and deny care.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I don't believe we should 
		give government bureaucrats or insurance company bureaucrats more 
		control over health care in America.&nbsp; I believe it's time to give the 
		American people more control over their health care and their health 
		insurance.&nbsp; I don't believe we can afford to leave life-and-death 
		decisions about health care to the discretion of insurance company 
		executives alone.&nbsp; I believe that doctors and nurses and physician 
		assistants like the ones in this room should be free to decide what's 
		best for their patients.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the proposal I put 
		forward gives Americans more control over their health insurance and 
		their health care by holding insurance companies more accountable.&nbsp; It 
		builds on the current system where most Americans get their health 
		insurance from their employer.&nbsp; If you like your plan, you can keep your 
		plan.&nbsp; If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.&nbsp; I can tell 
		you as the father of two young girls, I would not want any plan that 
		interferes with the relationship between a family and their doctor.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Essentially, my proposal 
		would change three things about the current health care system.&nbsp; First, 
		it would end the worst practices of insurance companies.&nbsp; No longer 
		would they be able to deny your coverage because of a preexisting 
		condition.&nbsp; No longer would they be able to drop your coverage because 
		you got sick.&nbsp; No longer would they be able to force you to pay 
		unlimited amounts of money out of your own pocket.&nbsp; No longer would they 
		be able to arbitrarily and massively raise premiums like Anthem Blue 
		Cross recently tried to do in California -- up to 39 percent increases 
		in one year in the individual market.&nbsp; Those practices would end.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, my proposal would 
		give uninsured individuals and small business owners the same kind of 
		choice of private health insurance that members of Congress get for 
		themselves -- because if it’s good enough for members of Congress, it’s 
		good enough for the people who pay their salaries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The reason federal employees 
		get a good deal on health insurance is that we all participate in an 
		insurance market where insurance companies give better coverage and 
		better rates, because they get more customers.&nbsp; It's an idea that many 
		Republicans have embraced in the past, before politics intruded.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And my proposal says that if 
		you still can’t afford the insurance in this new marketplace, even 
		though it's going to provide better deals for people than they can get 
		right now in the individual marketplace, then we'll offer you tax 
		credits to do so -- tax credits that add up to the largest middle-class 
		tax cut for health care in history.&nbsp; After all, the wealthiest 
		among us can already buy the best insurance there is, and the least well 
		off are able to get coverage through Medicaid.&nbsp; So it's the middle 
		class that gets squeezed, and that’s who we have to help.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, it is absolutely true that all of this will cost some money -- 
		about $100 billion per year.&nbsp; But most of this comes from the nearly $2 
		trillion a year that America already spends on health care -- but a lot 
		of it is not spent wisely.&nbsp; A lot of that money is being wasted or spent 
		badly.&nbsp; So within this plan, we’re going to make sure the dollars we 
		spend go towards making insurance more affordable and more secure.&nbsp; 
		We’re going to eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go 
		to insurance and pharmaceutical companies; set a new fee on insurance 
		companies that stand to gain a lot of money and a lot of profits as 
		millions of Americans are able to buy insurance; and we're going to make 
		sure that the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share on Medicare.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The bottom line is our 
		proposal is paid for.&nbsp; And all the new money generated in this plan goes 
		back to small businesses and middle-class families who can't afford 
		health insurance.&nbsp; It would also lower prescription drug prices for 
		seniors.&nbsp; And it would help train new doctors and nurses and physician 
		assistants to provide care for American families.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, my proposal would 
		bring down the cost of health care for millions -- families, businesses, 
		and the federal government.&nbsp; We have now incorporated most of the 
		serious ideas from across the political spectrum about how to contain 
		the rising cost of health care -- ideas that go after the waste and 
		abuse in our system, especially in programs like Medicare.&nbsp; But we do 
		this while protecting Medicare benefits, and extending the financial 
		stability of the program by nearly a decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our cost-cutting measures 
		mirror most of the proposals in the current Senate bill, which reduces 
		most people's premiums and brings down our deficit by up to a trillion 
		dollars over the next two decades -- brings down our deficit.&nbsp; Those 
		aren't my numbers; those are the savings determined by the Congressional 
		Budget Office, which is the Washington acronym for the nonpartisan, 
		independent referee of Congress in terms of how much stuff costs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So that's our proposal.&nbsp; 
		This is where we've ended up.&nbsp; It's an approach that has been debated 
		and changed and I believe improved over the last year.&nbsp; It incorporates 
		the best ideas from Democrats and Republicans -- including some of the 
		ideas that Republicans offered during the health care summit, like 
		funding state grants on medical malpractice reform, and curbing waste 
		and fraud and abuse in the health care system.&nbsp; My proposal also gets 
		rid of many of the provisions that had no place in health care reform -- 
		provisions that were more about winning individual votes in Congress 
		than improving health care for all Americans.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, despite all that we 
		agree on and all the Republican ideas we've incorporated, many -- 
		probably most -- Republicans in Congress just have a fundamental 
		disagreement over whether we should have more or less oversight of 
		insurance companies.&nbsp; And if they truly believe that less regulation 
		would lead to higher quality, more affordable health insurance, then 
		they should vote against the proposal I've put forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, some also believe that 
		we should, instead of doing what I'm proposing, pursue a piecemeal 
		approach to health insurance reform, where we tinker around the edges of 
		this challenge for the next few years.&nbsp; Even those who acknowledge the 
		problem of the uninsured say we just can't afford to help them right now 
		-- which is why the Republican proposal only covers 3 million uninsured 
		Americans while we cover over 31 million.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The problem with that 
		approach is that unless everyone has access to affordable coverage, you 
		can't prevent insurance companies from denying coverage based on 
		preexisting conditions; you can't limit the amount families are forced 
		to pay out of their own pockets.&nbsp; The insurance reforms rest on 
		everybody having access to coverage.&nbsp; And you also don't do anything 
		about the fact that taxpayers currently end up subsidizing the uninsured 
		when they're forced to go to the emergency room for care, to the tune of 
		about a thousand bucks per family.&nbsp; You can't get those savings if those 
		people are still going to the emergency room.&nbsp; So the fact is, health 
		reform only works if you take care of all of these problems at once.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, both during and after 
		last week's summit, Republicans in Congress insisted that the only 
		acceptable course on health care reform is to start over.&nbsp; But given 
		these honest and substantial differences between the parties about the 
		need to regulate the insurance industry and the need to help millions of 
		middle-class families get insurance, I don't see how another year of 
		negotiations would help.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, the insurance 
		companies aren't starting over.&nbsp; They're continuing to raise premiums 
		and deny coverage as we speak.&nbsp; For us to start over now could simply 
		lead to delay that could last for another decade, or even more.&nbsp; The 
		American people, and the U.S. economy, just can't wait that long.&nbsp; So, 
		no matter which approach you favor, I believe the United States Congress 
		owes the American people a final vote on health care reform.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have debated this issue 
		thoroughly, not just for the past year but for decades.&nbsp; Reform has 
		already passed the House with a majority.&nbsp; It has already passed the 
		Senate with a supermajority of 60 votes.&nbsp; And now it deserves the same 
		kind of up or down vote that was cast on welfare reform, that was cast 
		on the Children's Health Insurance Program, that was used for COBRA 
		health coverage for the unemployed, and, by the way, for both Bush tax 
		cuts -- all of which had to pass Congress with nothing more than a 
		simple majority.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I, therefore, ask leaders in 
		both houses of Congress to finish their work and schedule a vote in the 
		next few weeks.&nbsp; From now until then, I will do everything in my power 
		to make the case for reform.&nbsp; And I urge every American who 
		wants this reform to make their voice heard as well -- every family, 
		every business, every patient, every doctor, every nurse, every 
		physician’s assistant.&nbsp; Make your voice heard.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This has been a long and 
		wrenching debate.&nbsp; It has stoked great passions among the American 
		people and their representatives.&nbsp; And that's because health care is a 
		difficult issue.&nbsp; It is a complicated issue.&nbsp; If it was easy, it would 
		have been solved long ago.&nbsp; As all of you know from experience, health 
		care can literally be an issue of life or death.&nbsp; And as a result, it 
		easily lends itself to demagoguery and political gamesmanship, and 
		misrepresentation and misunderstanding.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But that’s not an excuse for 
		those of us who were sent here to lead.&nbsp; That's not an excuse for us to 
		walk away.&nbsp; We can’t just give up because the politics are hard.&nbsp; I know 
		there’s been a fascination, bordering on obsession, in this media town 
		about what passing health insurance reform would mean for the next 
		election and the one after that.&nbsp; How will this play?&nbsp; What will happen 
		with the polls?&nbsp; I will leave it to others to sift through the politics, 
		because that’s not what this is about.&nbsp; That’s not why we’re here.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is about what reform 
		would mean for the mother with breast cancer whose insurance company 
		will finally have to pay for her chemotherapy.&nbsp; This is about what 
		reform would mean for the small business owner who will no longer have 
		to choose between hiring more workers or offering coverage to the 
		employees she has.&nbsp; This is about what reform would mean for 
		middle-class families who will be able to afford health insurance for 
		the very first time in their lives and get a regular checkup once in a 
		while, and have some security about their children if they get sick.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is about what reform 
		would mean for all those men and women I’ve met over the last few years 
		who’ve been brave enough to share their stories.&nbsp; When we started our 
		push for reform last year, I talked to a young mother in Wisconsin named 
		Laura Klitzka.&nbsp; She has two young children.&nbsp; She thought she had beaten 
		her breast cancer but then later discovered it had spread to her bones.&nbsp; 
		She and her husband were working and had insurance, but their medical 
		bills still landed them in debt.&nbsp; And now she spends time worrying about 
		that debt when all she wants to do is spend time with her children and 
		focus on getting well.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This should not happen in 
		the United States of America.&nbsp; And it doesn’t have to.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end, that's what this 
		debate is about.&nbsp; It's about what kind of country we want to be.&nbsp; It's 
		about the millions of lives that would be touched and, in some cases, 
		saved by making private health insurance more secure and more 
		affordable.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So at stake right now is not 
		just our ability to solve this problem, but our ability to solve any 
		problem.&nbsp; The American people want to know if it's still possible for 
		Washington to look out for their interests and their future.&nbsp; They are 
		waiting for us to act.&nbsp; They are waiting for us to lead.&nbsp; And as long as 
		I hold this office, I intend to provide that leadership.&nbsp; I do not know 
		how this plays politically, but I know it's right.&nbsp; And so I ask 
		Congress to finish its work, and I look forward to signing this reform 
		into law.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, 
		everybody. Let's get it done.</font></p>
