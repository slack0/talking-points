		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#FF0000">[as prepared 
		for delivery]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you very much. To 
		General Haley for the outstanding work he is doing. Thank you so much.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Good morning Marines. Good 
		morning Camp Lejeune. Good morning Jacksonville. Thank you for that 
		outstanding welcome. I want to thank Lieutenant General Hejlik for 
		hosting me here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I also want to acknowledge 
		all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines serving in Iraq and 
		Afghanistan. That includes the Camp Lejeune Marines now serving with – 
		or soon joining – the Second Marine Expeditionary Force in Iraq; those 
		with Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force in Afghanistan; and 
		those among the 8,000 Marines who are preparing to deploy to 
		Afghanistan. We have you in our prayers. We pay tribute to your service. 
		We thank you and your families for all that you do for America. And I 
		want all of you to know that there is no higher honor or greater 
		responsibility than serving as your Commander-in-Chief.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I also want to take this 
		opportunity to acknowledge Ryan Crocker, who recently completed his 
		service as our Ambassador to Iraq. Throughout his career, Ryan always 
		took on the toughest assignments. He is an example of the very best that 
		this nation has to offer, and we owe him a great debt of gratitude. He 
		carried on his work with an extraordinary degree of cooperation with two 
		of our finest Generals – General David Petraeus, and General Ray Odierno 
		– who will be critical in carrying forward the strategy that I will 
		outline today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next month will mark the 
		sixth anniversary of the war in Iraq. By any measure, this has already 
		been a long war. For the men and women of America’s armed forces – and 
		for your families – this war has been one of the most extraordinary 
		chapters of service in the history of our nation. You have endured tour 
		after tour after tour of duty. You have known the dangers of combat and 
		the lonely distance of loved ones. You have fought against tyranny and 
		disorder. You have bled for your best friends and for unknown Iraqis. 
		And you have borne an enormous burden for your fellow citizens, while 
		extending a precious opportunity to the people of Iraq. Under tough 
		circumstances, the men and women of the United States military have 
		served with honor, and succeeded beyond any expectation. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Today, I have come to speak 
		to you about how the war in Iraq will end.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">To understand where we need 
		to go in Iraq, it is important for the American people to understand 
		where we now stand. Thanks in great measure to your service, the 
		situation in Iraq has improved. Violence has been reduced substantially 
		from the horrific sectarian killing of 2006 and 2007. Al Qaeda in Iraq 
		has been dealt a serious blow by our troops and Iraq’s Security Forces, 
		and through our partnership with Sunni Arabs. The capacity of Iraq’s 
		Security Forces has improved, and Iraq’s leaders have taken steps toward 
		political accommodation. The relative peace and strong participation in 
		January’s provincial elections sent a powerful message to the world 
		about how far Iraqis have come in pursuing their aspirations through a 
		peaceful political process.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">But let there be no doubt: 
		Iraq is not yet secure, and there will be difficult days ahead. Violence 
		will continue to be a part of life in Iraq. Too many fundamental 
		political questions about Iraq’s future remain unresolved. Too many 
		Iraqis are still displaced or destitute. Declining oil revenues will put 
		an added strain on a government that has had difficulty delivering basic 
		services. Not all of Iraq’s neighbors are contributing to its security. 
		Some are working at times to undermine it. And even as Iraq’s government 
		is on a surer footing, it is not yet a full partner – politically and 
		economically – in the region, or with the international community</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In short, today there is a 
		renewed cause for hope in Iraq, but that hope rests upon an emerging 
		foundation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">On my first full day in 
		office, I directed my national security team to undertake a 
		comprehensive review of our strategy in Iraq to determine the best way 
		to strengthen that foundation, while strengthening American national 
		security. I have listened to my Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs 
		of Staff, and commanders on the ground. We have acted with careful 
		consideration of events on the ground; with respect for the security 
		agreements between the United States and Iraq; and with a critical 
		recognition that the long-term solution in Iraq must be political – not 
		military. Because the most important decisions that have to be made 
		about Iraq’s future must now be made by Iraqis.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We have also taken into 
		account the simple reality that America can no longer afford to see Iraq 
		in isolation from other priorities: we face the challenge of refocusing 
		on Afghanistan and Pakistan; of relieving the burden on our military; 
		and of rebuilding our struggling economy – and these are challenges that 
		we will meet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Today, I can announce that 
		our review is complete, and that the United States will pursue a new 
		strategy to end the war in Iraq through a transition to full Iraqi 
		responsibility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This strategy is grounded in 
		a clear and achievable goal shared by the Iraqi people and the American 
		people: an Iraq that is sovereign, stable, and self-reliant. To achieve 
		that goal, we will work to promote an Iraqi government that is just, 
		representative, and accountable, and that provides neither support nor 
		safe-haven to terrorists. We will help Iraq build new ties of trade and 
		commerce with the world. And we will forge a partnership with the people 
		and government of Iraq that contributes to the peace and security of the 
		region.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">What we will not do is let 
		the pursuit of the perfect stand in the way of achievable goals. We 
		cannot rid Iraq of all who oppose America or sympathize with our 
		adversaries. We cannot police Iraq’s streets until they are completely 
		safe, nor stay until Iraq’s union is perfected. We cannot sustain 
		indefinitely a commitment that has put a strain on our military, and 
		will cost the American people nearly a trillion dollars. America’s men 
		and women in uniform have fought block by block, province by province, 
		year after year, to give the Iraqis this chance to choose a better 
		future. Now, we must ask the Iraqi people to seize it. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The first part of this 
		strategy is therefore the responsible removal of our combat brigades 
		from Iraq.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Arial" size="2"> As a candidate for 
		President, I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry 
		out this drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our military 
		commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains we’ve 
		made and protect our troops. Those consultations are now complete, and I 
		have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the 
		next 18 months.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Let me say this as plainly 
		as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As we carry out this 
		drawdown, my highest priority will be the safety and security of our 
		troops and civilians in Iraq. We will proceed carefully, and I will 
		consult closely with my military commanders on the ground and with the 
		Iraqi government. There will surely be difficult periods and tactical 
		adjustments. But our enemies should be left with no doubt: this plan 
		gives our military the forces and the flexibility they need to support 
		our Iraqi partners, and to succeed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">After we remove our combat 
		brigades, our mission will change from combat to supporting the Iraqi 
		government and its Security Forces as they take the absolute lead in 
		securing their country. As I have long said, we will retain a 
		transitional force to carry out three distinct functions: training, 
		equipping, and advising Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain 
		non-sectarian; conducting targeted counter-terrorism missions; and 
		protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq. 
		Initially, this force will likely be made up of 35-50,000 U.S. troops.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Through this period of 
		transition, we will carry out further redeployments. And under the 
		Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi government, I intend to remove 
		all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. We will complete this 
		transition to Iraqi responsibility, and we will bring our troops home 
		with the honor that they have earned.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As we responsibly remove our 
		combat brigades, we will pursue the second part of our strategy: 
		sustained diplomacy on behalf of a more peaceful and prosperous Iraq.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The drawdown of our military 
		should send a clear signal that Iraq’s future is now its own 
		responsibility. The long-term success of the Iraqi nation will depend 
		upon decisions made by Iraq’s leaders and the fortitude of the Iraqi 
		people. Iraq is a sovereign country with legitimate institutions; 
		America cannot – and should not – take their place. However, a strong 
		political, diplomatic, and civilian effort on our part can advance 
		progress and help lay a foundation for lasting peace and security.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This effort will be led by 
		our new Ambassador to Iraq – Chris Hill. From his time in the Peace 
		Corps, to his work in Kosovo and Korea, Ambassador Hill has been tested, 
		and he has shown the pragmatism and skill that we need right now. He 
		will be supported by the courageous and capable work of so many American 
		diplomats and aid workers who are serving in Iraq.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Going forward, we can make a 
		difference on several fronts. We will work with the United Nations to 
		support national elections, while helping Iraqis improve local 
		government. We can serve as an honest broker in pursuit of fair and 
		durable agreements on issues that have divided Iraq’s leaders. And just 
		as we will support Iraq’s Security Forces, we will help Iraqi 
		institutions strengthen their capacity to protect the rule of law, 
		confront corruption, and deliver basic services.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Diplomacy and assistance is 
		also required to help the millions of displaced Iraqis. These men, women 
		and children are a living consequence of this war and a challenge to 
		stability in the region, and they must become a part of Iraq’s 
		reconciliation and recovery. America has a strategic interest – and a 
		moral responsibility – to act. In the coming months, my administration 
		will provide more assistance and take steps to increase international 
		support for countries already hosting refugees; we’ll cooperate with 
		others to resettle Iraqis facing great personal risk; and we will work 
		with the Iraqi government over time to resettle refugees and displaced 
		Iraqis within Iraq – because there are few more powerful indicators of 
		lasting peace than displaced citizens returning home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, before I go any 
		further, I want to take a moment to speak directly to the people of 
		Iraq.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You are a great nation, 
		rooted in the cradle of civilization. You are joined together by 
		enduring accomplishments, and a history that connects you as surely as 
		the two rivers carved into your land. In years past, you have persevered 
		through tyranny and terror; through personal insecurity and sectarian 
		violence. And instead of giving in to the forces of disunion, you 
		stepped back from a descent into civil war, and showed a proud 
		resilience that deserves respect.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Our nations have known 
		difficult times together. But ours is a bond forged by shared bloodshed, 
		and countless friendships among our people. We Americans have offered 
		our most precious resource -- our young men and women -- to work with you 
		to rebuild what was destroyed by despotism; to root out our common 
		enemies; and to seek peace and prosperity for our children and 
		grandchildren, and for yours.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There are those who will try 
		to prevent that future for Iraq – who will insist that Iraq’s 
		differences cannot be reconciled without more killing. They represent 
		the forces that destroy nations and lead only to despair, and they will 
		test our will in the months and years to come. America, too, has known 
		these forces. We endured the pain of Civil War, and bitter divisions of 
		region and race. But hostility and hatred are no match for justice; they 
		offer no pathway to peace; and they must not stand between the people of 
		Iraq and a future of reconciliation and hope.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">So to the Iraqi people, let 
		me be clear about America’s intentions. The United States pursues no 
		claim on your territory or your resources. We respect your sovereignty 
		and the tremendous sacrifices you have made for your country. We seek a 
		full transition to Iraqi responsibility for the security of your 
		country. And going forward, we can build a lasting relationship founded 
		upon mutual interests and mutual respect as Iraq takes its rightful 
		place in the community of nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">That leads me to the third 
		part of our strategy -- comprehensive American engagement across the 
		region.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The future of Iraq is 
		inseparable from the future of the broader Middle East, so we must work 
		with our friends and partners to establish a new framework that advances 
		Iraq’s security and the region’s. It is time for Iraq to be a full 
		partner in a regional dialogue, and for Iraq’s neighbors to establish 
		productive and normalized relations with Iraq. And going forward, the 
		United States will pursue principled and sustained engagement with all 
		of the nations in the region, and that will include Iran and Syria.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This reflects a fundamental 
		truth: we can no longer deal with regional challenges in isolation – we 
		need a smarter, more sustainable and comprehensive approach. That is why 
		we are renewing our diplomacy, while relieving the burden on our 
		military. That is why we are refocusing on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and 
		Pakistan; developing a strategy to use all elements of American power to 
		prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon; and actively seeking a 
		lasting peace between Israel and the Arab world. &nbsp;And that is why we 
		have named three of America’s most accomplished diplomats – George 
		Mitchell, Dennis Ross and Richard Holbrooke – to support Secretary 
		Clinton and me as we carry forward this agenda.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Every nation and every group 
		must know -- whether you wish America good or ill -- that the end of the 
		war in Iraq will enable a new era of American leadership and engagement 
		in the Middle East. And that era has just begun.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, I want to be very 
		clear that my strategy for ending the war in Iraq does not end with 
		military plans or diplomatic agendas – it endures through our commitment 
		to uphold our sacred trust with every man and woman who has served in 
		Iraq.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Arial" size="2"> You make up a fraction of 
		the American population, but in an age when so many people and 
		institutions have acted irresponsibly, you did the opposite – you 
		volunteered to bear the heaviest burden. And for you and for your 
		families, the war does not end when you come home. It lives on in 
		memories of your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who gave 
		their lives. It endures in the wound that is slow to heal, the 
		disability that isn’t going away, the dream that wakes you at night, or 
		the stiffening in your spine when a car backfires down the street.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You and your families have 
		done your duty – now a grateful nation must do ours. That is why I am 
		increasing the number of soldiers and Marines, so that we lessen the 
		burden on those who are serving. And that is why I have committed to 
		expanding our system of veterans health care to serve more patients, and 
		to provide better care in more places. We will continue building new 
		wounded warrior facilities across America, and invest in new ways of 
		identifying and treating the signature wounds of this war: 
		Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury, as well as 
		other combat injuries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We also know that service 
		does not end with the person wearing the uniform. In her visits with 
		military families across the country, my wife Michelle has learned 
		firsthand about the unique burden that your families endure every day. I 
		want you to know this: military families are a top priority for Michelle 
		and me, and they will be a top priority for my administration. We’ll 
		raise military pay, and continue providing quality child-care, 
		job-training for spouses, and expanded counseling and outreach to 
		families that have known the separation and stress of war. We will also 
		heed the lesson of history – that those who fight in battle can form the 
		backbone of our middle class – by implementing a 21st century GI Bill to 
		help our veterans live their dreams.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As a nation, we have had our 
		share of debates about the war in Iraq. It has, at times, divided us as 
		a people. To this very day, there are some Americans who want to stay in 
		Iraq longer, and some who want to leave faster. But there should be no 
		disagreement on what the men and women of our military have achieved.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And so I want to be very 
		clear: We sent our troops to Iraq to do away with Saddam Hussein’s 
		regime – and you got the job done. We kept our troops in Iraq to help 
		establish a sovereign government – and you got the job done. And we will 
		leave the Iraqi people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better 
		life – that is your achievement; that is the prospect that you have made 
		possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There are many lessons to be 
		learned from what we’ve experienced. We have learned that America must 
		go to war with clearly defined goals, which is why I’ve ordered a review 
		of our policy in Afghanistan. We have learned that we must always weigh 
		the costs of action, and communicate those costs candidly to the 
		American people, which is why I’ve put Iraq and Afghanistan into my 
		budget. We have learned that in the 21st century, we must use all 
		elements of American power to achieve our objectives, which is why I am 
		committed to building our civilian national security capacity so that 
		the burden is not continually pushed on to our military. We have learned 
		that our political leaders must pursue the broad and bipartisan support 
		that our national security policies depend upon, which is why I will 
		consult with Congress and in carrying out my plans. And we have learned 
		the importance of working closely with friends and allies, which is why 
		we are launching a new era of engagement in the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The starting point for our 
		policies must always be the safety of the American people. I know that 
		you – the men and women of the finest fighting force in the history of 
		the world – can meet any challenge, and defeat any foe. And as long as I 
		am your Commander-in-Chief, I promise you that I will only send you into 
		harm’s way when it is absolutely necessary, and provide you with the 
		equipment and support you need to get the job done. That is the most 
		important lesson of all – for the consequences of war are dire, the 
		sacrifices immeasurable. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You know because you have 
		seen those sacrifices. You have lived them. And we all honor them.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; – it means 
		always being faithful to Corps, and to country, and to the memory of 
		fallen comrades like Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan 
		Haerter. These young men enlisted in a time of war, knowing they would 
		face great danger. They came here, to Camp Lejeune, as they trained for 
		their mission. And last April, they were standing guard in Anbar. In an 
		age when suicide is a weapon, they were suddenly faced with an oncoming 
		truck filled with explosives. These two Marines stood their ground. 
		These two Marines opened fire. And these two Marines stopped that truck. 
		When the thousands of pounds of explosives detonated, they had saved 
		fifty Marines and Iraqi police who would have been in the truck’s path, 
		but Corporal Yale and Lance Corporal Haerter lost their own lives. 
		Jonathan was 21. Jordan was 19.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the town where Jordan 
		Haerter was from, a bridge was dedicated in his name. One Marine who 
		traveled to the ceremony said: &quot;We flew here from all over the country 
		to pay tribute to our friend Jordan, who risked his life to save us. We 
		wouldn’t be here without him.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">America’s time in Iraq is 
		filled with stories of men and women like this. Their names are written 
		into bridges and town squares. They are etched into stones at Arlington, 
		and in quiet places of rest across our land. They are spoken in schools 
		and on city blocks. They live on in the memories of those who wear your 
		uniform, in the hearts of those they loved, and in the freedom of the 
		nation they served.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Each American who has served 
		in Iraq has their own story. Each of you has your own story. And that 
		story is now a part of the history of the United States of America – a 
		nation that exists only because free men and women have bled for it from 
		the beaches of Normandy to the deserts of Anbar; from the mountains of 
		Korea to the streets of Kandahar. You teach us that the price of freedom 
		is great. Your sacrifice should challenge all of us – every single 
		American – to ask what we can do to be better citizens.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There will be more danger in 
		the months ahead. We will face new tests and unforeseen trials. But 
		thanks to the sacrifices of those who have served, we have forged 
		hard-earned progress, we are leaving Iraq to its people, and we have 
		begun the work of ending this war.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you, God Bless you, 
		and God Bless the United States of America. Semper Fi.</font></p>
