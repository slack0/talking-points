<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">President Obama:&nbsp; Hello, Rio 
		de Janeiro!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audience:&nbsp; Hello!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audience Member:&nbsp; Many 
		welcomes!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">President Obama:&nbsp; Alo!&nbsp; 
		Cidade!&nbsp; Maravilhoso!&nbsp;Boa tarde, todo o povo brasileiro. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since the moment we arrived, 
		the people of this nation have graciously shown my family the warmth and 
		generosity of the Brazilian spirit.&nbsp; Obrigado.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;  
		And I want to give a special thanks to all of you for being here, 
		because I've been told that there’s a Vasco football game coming. Botafogo -- So I know that -- I realize Brazilians don’t give up their 
		soccer very easily.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, one of my earliest 
		impressions of Brazil was a movie I saw with my mother as a very young 
		child, a movie called Black Orpheus, that is set in the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favelas"><font color="#0000FF">
		favelas</font></a> of Rio during Carnival.&nbsp; And my mother loved that 
		movie, with its singing and dancing against the backdrop of the 
		beautiful green hills.&nbsp; And it first premiered as a play right here in 
		Teatro Municipal.&nbsp; That's my understanding.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And my mother is gone now, 
		but she would have never imagined that her son’s first trip to Brazil 
		would be as President of the United States.&nbsp; She would have never 
		imagined that.&nbsp;And I never imagined that this country would be even more 
		beautiful than it was in the movie.&nbsp; You are, as Jorge Ben-Jor sang, “A 
		tropical country, blessed by God, and beautiful by nature.”&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ve seen that beauty in the 
		cascading hillsides, in your endless miles of sand and ocean, and in the 
		vibrant, diverse gatherings of brasileiros who have come here today.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we have a wonderfully 
		mixed group.&nbsp; We have Cariocas and Paulistas, Baianas, Mineiros.&nbsp;We’ve 
		got men and women from the cities to the interior, and so many young 
		people here who are the great future of this great nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, yesterday, I met with 
		your wonderful new President,
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilma_Rousseff">
		<font color="#0000FF">Dilma Rousseff</font></a>, and talked about how we 
		can strengthen the partnership between our governments.&nbsp; But today, I 
		want to speak directly to the Brazilian people about how we can 
		strengthen the friendship between our nations.&nbsp; I’ve come here to share 
		some ideas because I want to speak of the values that we share, the 
		hopes that we have in common, and the difference that we can make 
		together.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When you think about it, the 
		journeys of the United States of America and Brazil began in similar 
		ways.&nbsp; Our lands are rich with God’s creation, home to ancient and 
		indigenous peoples.&nbsp; From overseas, the Americas were discovered by men 
		who sought a New World, and settled by pioneers who pushed westward, 
		across vast frontiers.&nbsp; We became colonies claimed by distant crowns, 
		but soon declared our independence.&nbsp; We then welcomed waves of 
		immigrants to our shores, and eventually after a long struggle, we 
		cleansed the stain of slavery from our land.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The United States was the 
		first nation to recognize Brazil’s independence, and set up a diplomatic 
		outpost in this country.&nbsp; The first head of state to visit the United 
		States was the leader of Brazil, Dom Pedro II.&nbsp; In the Second World War, 
		our brave men and women fought side-by-side for freedom.&nbsp; And after the 
		war, both of our nations struggled to achieve the full blessings of 
		liberty.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the streets of the United 
		States, men and women marched and bled and some died so that every 
		citizen could enjoy the same freedoms and opportunities -- no matter 
		what you looked like, no matter where you came from.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Brazil, you fought 
		against two decades of dictatorships for the same right to be heard -– 
		the right to be free from fear, free from want.&nbsp; And yet, for years, 
		democracy and development were slow to take hold, and millions suffered 
		as a result.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I come here today 
		because those days have passed.&nbsp; Brazil today is a flourishing democracy 
		-- a place where people are free to speak their mind and choose their 
		leaders; where a poor kid from
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco"><font color="#0000FF">
		Pernambuco</font></a> can rise from the floors of a copper factory to 
		the highest office in Brazil.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over the last decade, the 
		progress made by the Brazilian people has inspired the world.&nbsp; More than 
		half of this nation is now considered middle class.&nbsp; Millions have been 
		lifted from poverty.&nbsp; For the first time, hope is returning to places 
		where fear had long prevailed.&nbsp; I saw this today when I visited
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_God_(2002_film)">
		<font color="#0000FF">Cidade de Deus -- the City of God</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It isn’t just the new 
		security efforts and social programs&nbsp; -- and I want to congratulate the 
		mayor and the governor for the excellent work that they’re doing. But 
		it’s also a change in attitudes.&nbsp; As one young resident said, “People 
		have to look at favelas not with pity, but as a source of presidents and 
		lawyers and doctors, artists, [and] people with solutions.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With each passing day, 
		Brazil is a country with more solutions.&nbsp; In the global community, 
		you’ve gone from relying on the help of other nations, to now helping 
		fight poverty and disease wherever they exist.&nbsp; You play an important 
		role in the global institutions that protect our common security and 
		promote our common prosperity.&nbsp; And you will welcome the world to your 
		shores when the World Cup and the Olympic games come to Rio de Janeiro.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><object width="257" height="211"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/90sGXkYeUk0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/90sGXkYeUk0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="257" height="211"></embed></object>
		</font>
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;Now, you may be aware that 
		this city was not my first choice for the Summer Olympics.&nbsp; But if the 
		games could not be held in Chicago, then there’s no place I’d rather see 
		them than right here in Rio.&nbsp; And I intend to come back in 2016 to watch 
		what happens.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For so long, Brazil was a 
		nation brimming with potential but held back by politics, both at home 
		and abroad.&nbsp; For so long, you were called a country of the future, told 
		to wait for a better day that was always just around the corner.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meus amigos, that day has 
		finally come.&nbsp; And this is a country of the future no more.&nbsp; The people 
		of Brazil should know that the future has arrived.&nbsp; It is here now.&nbsp; And 
		it’s time to seize it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, our countries have not 
		always agreed on everything.&nbsp; And just like many nations, we’re going to 
		have our differences of opinion going forward.&nbsp; But I’m here to tell you 
		that the American people don’t just recognize Brazil’s success -- we 
		root for Brazil’s success.&nbsp; As you confront the many challenges you 
		still face at home as well as abroad, let us stand together -- not as 
		senior and junior partners, but as equal partners, joined in a spirit of 
		mutual interest and mutual respect, committed to the progress that I 
		know that we can make together.&nbsp; I'm confident we can do it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Together we can advance our 
		common prosperity.&nbsp; As two of the world’s largest economies, we worked 
		side by side during the financial crisis to restore growth and 
		confidence.&nbsp; And to keep our economies growing, we know what’s necessary 
		in both of our nations.&nbsp; We need a skilled, educated workforce -- which 
		is why American and Brazilian companies have pledged to help increase 
		student exchanges between our two nations.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We need a commitment to 
		innovation and technology -- which is why we've agreed to expand 
		cooperation between our scientists, researchers, and engineers.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We need world-class 
		infrastructure -- which is why American companies want to help you build 
		and prepare this city for Olympic success.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a global economy, the 
		United States and Brazil should expand trade, expand investment, so that 
		we create new jobs and new opportunities in both of our nations.&nbsp; And 
		that's why we're working to break down barriers to doing business.&nbsp; 
		That's why we're building closer relationships between our workers and 
		our entrepreneurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Together we can also promote 
		energy security and protect our beautiful planet.&nbsp; As two nations that 
		are committed to greener economies, we know that the ultimate solution 
		to our energy challenges lies in clean and renewable power.&nbsp; And that’s 
		why half the vehicles in this country can run on biofuels, and most of 
		your electricity comes from hydropower.&nbsp; That’s also why, in the United 
		States, we’ve jumpstarted a new clean energy industry. And that’s why 
		the United States and Brazil are creating new energy partnerships -- to 
		share technologies, create new jobs, and leave our children a world that 
		is cleaner and safer than we found it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Together, our two nations 
		can also help defend our citizens’ security.&nbsp; We’re working together to 
		stop narco-trafficking that has destroyed too many lives in this 
		hemisphere.&nbsp; We seek the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.&nbsp; We’re 
		working together to enhance nuclear security across our hemisphere.&nbsp; 
		From Africa to Haiti, we are working side by side to combat the hunger, 
		disease, and corruption that can rot a society and rob human beings of 
		dignity and opportunity.&nbsp;And as two countries that have 
		been greatly enriched by our African heritage, it’s absolutely vital 
		that we are working with the continent of Africa to help lift it up.&nbsp; 
		That is something that we should be committed to doing together.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, we’re both also 
		delivering assistance and support to the Japanese people at their 
		greatest hour of need.&nbsp; The ties that bind our nations to Japan are 
		strong.&nbsp; In Brazil, you are home to the largest Japanese population 
		outside of Japan.&nbsp; In the United States, we forged an alliance of more 
		than 60 years.&nbsp; The people of Japan are some of our closest friends, and 
		we will pray with them, and stand with them, and rebuild with them until 
		this crisis has passed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In these and other efforts 
		to promote peace and prosperity throughout the world, the United States 
		and Brazil are partners not just because we share history, not just 
		because we’re in the same hemisphere; not just because we share ties of 
		commerce and culture, but also because we share certain enduring values 
		and ideals.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We both believe in the power 
		and promise of democracy.&nbsp; We believe that no other form of government 
		is more effective at promoting growth and prosperity that reaches every 
		human being -- not just some but all.&nbsp; And those who argue otherwise, 
		those who argue that democracy stands in the way of economic progress, 
		they must contend with the example of Brazil.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The millions in this country 
		who have climbed from poverty into the middle class, they could not do 
		so in a closed economy controlled by the state.&nbsp; You’re prospering as a 
		free people with open markets and a government that answers to its 
		citizens.&nbsp; You’re proving that the goal of social justice and social 
		inclusion can be best achieved through freedom -– that democracy is the 
		greatest partner of human progress.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We also believe that in 
		nations as big and diverse as ours, shaped by generations of immigrants 
		from every race and faith and background, democracy offers the best hope 
		that every citizen is treated with dignity and respect, and that we can 
		resolve our differences peacefully, that we find strength in our 
		diversity.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We know that experience in 
		the United States.&nbsp; We know how important it is to be able to work 
		together -- even when we often disagree.&nbsp; I understand that our chosen 
		form of government can be slow and messy.&nbsp; We understand that democracy 
		must be constantly strengthened and perfected over time.&nbsp; We know that 
		different nations take different paths to realize the promise of 
		democracy. And we understand that no one nation should impose its will 
		on another.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we also know that 
		there’s certain aspirations shared by every human being:&nbsp; We all seek to 
		be free.&nbsp; We all seek to be heard.&nbsp; We all yearn to live without fear or 
		discrimination.&nbsp; We all yearn to choose how we are governed.&nbsp; And we all 
		want to shape our own destiny.&nbsp; These are not American ideals or 
		Brazilian ideals.&nbsp; These are not Western ideals.&nbsp; These are universal 
		rights, and we must support them everywhere.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, we are seeing the 
		struggle for these rights unfold across the Middle East and North 
		Africa.&nbsp; We’ve seen a revolution born out of a yearning for basic human 
		dignity in Tunisia.&nbsp; We’ve seen peaceful protestors pour into Tahrir 
		Square -- men and women, young and old, Christian and Muslim.&nbsp; We’ve 
		seen the people of Libya take a courageous stand against a regime 
		determined to brutalize its own citizens.&nbsp; Across the region, we’ve seen 
		young people rise up -- a new generation demanding the right to 
		determine their own future.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">From the beginning, we have 
		made clear that the change they seek must be driven by their own 
		people.&nbsp; But for our two nations, for the United States and Brazil, two 
		nations who have struggled over many generations to perfect our own 
		democracies, the United States and Brazil know that the future of the 
		Arab World will be determined by its people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No one can say for certain 
		how this change will end, but I do know that change is not something 
		that we should fear.&nbsp; When young people insist that the currents of 
		history are on the move, the burdens of the past can be washed away.&nbsp; 
		When men and women peacefully claim their human rights, our own common 
		humanity is enhanced.&nbsp; Wherever the light of freedom is lit, the world 
		becomes a brighter place.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is the example of 
		Brazil.&nbsp; That is the example of Brazil.&nbsp;Brazil -- a country that shows 
		that a dictatorship can become a thriving democracy.&nbsp; Brazil -- a 
		country that shows democracy delivers both freedom and opportunity to 
		its people.&nbsp; Brazil -- a country that shows how a call for change that 
		starts in the streets can transform a city, transform a country, 
		transform a world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decades ago, it was directly 
		outside of this theater, in Cinelandia Square, where the call for change 
		was heard in Brazil. Students and artists and political leaders of all 
		stripes would gather with banners that said, “Down with the 
		dictatorship.&nbsp; The people in power.”&nbsp; Their democratic aspirations would 
		not be fulfilled until years later, but one of the young Brazilians in 
		that generation’s movement would go on to forever change the history of 
		this country.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A child of an immigrant, her 
		participation in the movement led to her arrest and her imprisonment, 
		her torture at the hands of her own government.&nbsp; And so she knows what 
		it’s like to live without the most basic human rights that so many are 
		fighting for today.&nbsp; But she also knows what it is to persevere.&nbsp; She 
		knows what it is to overcome -- because today that woman is your 
		nation’s president, Dilma Rousseff.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our two nations face many 
		challenges.&nbsp; On the road ahead, we will certainly encounter many 
		obstacles.&nbsp; But in the end, it is our history that gives us hope for a 
		better tomorrow.&nbsp; It is the knowledge that the men and women who came 
		before us have triumphed over greater trials than these -- that we live 
		in places where ordinary people have done extraordinary things.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s that sense of 
		possibility, that sense of optimism that first drew pioneers to this New 
		World.&nbsp; It’s what binds our nations together as partners in this new 
		century.&nbsp; It’s why we believe, in the words of Paul Coelho, one of your 
		most famous writers, “With the strength of our love and our will, we can 
		change our destiny, as well as the destiny of many others.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Muito obrigado.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; 
		And may God bless our two nations.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</font></p>
