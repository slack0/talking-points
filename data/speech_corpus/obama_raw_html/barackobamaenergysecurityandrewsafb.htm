<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I -- I've got a few introductions that I 
		want to make very quickly before I start my remarks.&nbsp; First of all, I 
		think that by the end of his tenure we're going to know that Ken Salazar 
		is one of the finest Secretaries of Interior we've ever had.&nbsp; So please 
		give him a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Other members of what we 
		call our green team are here:&nbsp; Steven Chu, our Secretary of Energy; 
		Martha Johnson, the Administrator of the GSA; Nancy Sutley, the CEQ 
		Chair.&nbsp; We've got Carol Browner, who’s the White House Energy and 
		Climate Change Director.&nbsp; Please give them a big round of applause.&nbsp; 
		They put in a lot of work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Governor Martin O’Malley is 
		here, governor of Maryland.&nbsp; Ray Mabus, Secretary of the Navy, is 
		here.&nbsp;Admiral Gary Roughead, Chief of Naval Operations, is here, and we 
		appreciate his outstanding service.&nbsp; Thank you, Gar.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank Steven 
		Shepro, the base commander here at Andrews, and the leadership that's 
		present from the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ken and I were colleagues in 
		the Senate, and I appointed him because I knew that he would be a 
		faithful and pragmatic steward of our natural resources.&nbsp; And as 
		Secretary, he is changing the way that the Interior Department does 
		business so that we’re responsibly developing traditional sources of 
		energy and renewable sources of energy, from the wind on the high plains 
		to the suns in the desert to the waves off our coasts.&nbsp; And so I'm very 
		grateful to the work that he’s done in culminating in one of the 
		announcements that we’re making today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s also good to see so 
		many members of our Armed Forces here today.&nbsp; Andrews is the home of Air 
		Force One, and I appreciate everything that you do for me and my 
		family.&nbsp; I should point out that you’ve got a 100-percent on-time 
		departure record. You don’t charge for luggage -- so it’s a pretty good 
		deal.&nbsp; And I want to thank you not only for the support that you provide 
		me, but also for the service that you perform to keep our country safe 
		each and every day.&nbsp; So I'm very grateful to all of you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re here to talk about 
		America’s energy security, an issue that’s been a priority for my 
		administration since the day I took office.&nbsp; Already, we’ve made the 
		largest investment in clean energy in our nation’s history.&nbsp; It’s an 
		investment that’s expected to create or save more than 700,000 jobs 
		across America -- jobs manufacturing advanced batteries for more 
		efficient vehicles; upgrading the power grid so that it’s smarter and 
		it’s stronger; doubling our nation’s capacity to generate renewable 
		electricity from sources like the wind and the sun.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And just a few months after 
		taking office, I also gathered the leaders of the world’s largest 
		automakers, the heads of labor unions, environmental advocates, and 
		public officials from California and across the country to reach a 
		historic agreement to raise fuel economy standards in cars and trucks.&nbsp; 
		And tomorrow, after decades in which we have done little to increase 
		auto efficiency, those new standards will be finalized, which will 
		reduce our dependence on oil while helping folks spend a little less at 
		the pump.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So my administration is 
		upholding its end of the deal, and we expect all parties to do the 
		same.&nbsp; And I’d also point out this rule that we’re going to be 
		announcing about increased mileage standards will save 1.8 billion -- 
		billion barrels of oil overall -- 1.8 billion barrels of oil.&nbsp; And 
		that’s like taking 58 million cars off the road for an entire year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, we’re also going to 
		go one step further.&nbsp; In order to save energy and taxpayer dollars, my 
		administration -- led by Secretary Chu at Energy, as well as 
		Administrator Johnson at GSA -- is doubling the number of hybrid 
		vehicles in the federal fleet, even as we seek to reduce the number of 
		cars and trucks used by our government overall.&nbsp; So we’re going to lead 
		by example and practice what we preach:&nbsp; cutting waste, saving energy, 
		and reducing our reliance on foreign oil.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we have to do more.&nbsp; We 
		need to make continued investments in clean coal technologies and 
		advanced biofuels.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I announced loan guarantees to 
		break ground on America’s first new nuclear facility in three decades, a 
		project that will create thousands of jobs.&nbsp; And in the short term, as 
		we transition to cleaner energy sources, we’ve still got to make some 
		tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas 
		development in ways that protect communities and protect coastlines.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is not a decision that 
		I’ve made lightly.&nbsp; It’s one that Ken and I -- as well as Carol Browner, 
		my energy advisor, and others in my administration -- looked at closely 
		for more than a year.&nbsp; But the bottom line is this:&nbsp; Given our energy 
		needs, in order to sustain economic growth and produce jobs, and keep 
		our businesses competitive, we are going to need to harness traditional 
		sources of fuel even as we ramp up production of new sources of 
		renewable, homegrown energy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So today we’re announcing 
		the expansion of offshore oil and gas exploration, but in ways that 
		balance the need to harness domestic energy resources and the need to 
		protect America’s natural resources.&nbsp; Under the leadership of Secretary 
		Salazar, we’ll employ new technologies that reduce the impact of oil 
		exploration.&nbsp; We’ll protect areas that are vital to tourism, the 
		environment, and our national security.&nbsp; And we’ll be guided not by 
		political ideology, but by scientific evidence.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's why my administration 
		will consider potential areas for development in the mid and south 
		Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, while studying and protecting sensitive 
		areas in the Arctic.&nbsp; That’s why we’ll continue to support development 
		of leased areas off the North Slope of Alaska, while protecting Alaska’s 
		Bristol Bay.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be those who 
		strongly disagree with this decision, including those who say we should 
		not open any new areas to drilling.&nbsp; But what I want to emphasize is 
		that this announcement is part of a broader strategy that will move us 
		from an economy that runs on fossil fuels and foreign oil to one that 
		relies more on homegrown fuels and clean energy.&nbsp; And the only way this 
		transition will succeed is if it strengthens our economy in the short 
		term and the long run.&nbsp; To fail to recognize this reality would be a 
		mistake.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other side, there are 
		going to be some who argue that we don’t go nearly far enough; who 
		suggest we should open all our waters to energy exploration without any 
		restriction or regard for the broader environmental and economic 
		impact.&nbsp; And to those folks I’ve got to say this:&nbsp; We have less than 2 
		percent of the world’s oil reserves; we consume more than 20 percent of 
		the world’s oil.&nbsp; And what that means is that drilling alone can’t come 
		close to meeting our long-term energy needs.&nbsp; And for the sake of our 
		planet and our energy independence, we need to begin the transition to 
		cleaner fuels now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the answer is not 
		drilling everywhere all the time.&nbsp; But the answer is not, also, for us 
		to ignore the fact that we are going to need vital energy sources to 
		maintain our economic growth and our security.&nbsp; Ultimately, we need to 
		move beyond the tired debates of the left and the right, between 
		business leaders and environmentalists, between those who would claim 
		drilling is a cure all and those who would claim it has no place.&nbsp; 
		Because this issue is just too important to allow our progress to 
		languish while we fight the same old battles over and over again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For decades we’ve talked 
		about how our dependence on foreign oil threatens our economy -– yet our 
		will to act rises and falls with the price of a barrel of oil.&nbsp; When gas 
		gets expensive at the pump, suddenly everybody is an energy expert.&nbsp; And 
		when it goes back down, everybody is back to their old habits.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For decades we’ve talked 
		about the threat to future generations posed by our current system of 
		energy –- even as we can see the mounting evidence of climate change 
		from the Arctic Circle to the Gulf Coast.&nbsp; And this is particularly 
		relevant to all of you who are serving in uniform:&nbsp; For decades, we’ve 
		talked about the risks to our security created by dependence on foreign 
		oil, but that dependence has actually grown year after year after year 
		after year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And while our politics has 
		remained entrenched along these worn divides, the ground has shifted 
		beneath our feet.&nbsp; Around the world, countries are seeking an edge in 
		the global marketplace by investing in new ways of producing and saving 
		energy.&nbsp; From China to Germany, these nations recognize that the nation 
		that leads the clean energy economy will be the country that leads the 
		global economy.&nbsp; And meanwhile, here at home, as politicians in 
		Washington debate endlessly about whether to act, our own military has 
		determined that we can no longer afford not to.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of the press may be 
		wondering why we are announcing offshore drilling in a hangar at Andrews 
		Air Force Base.&nbsp; Well, if there’s any doubt about the leadership that 
		our military is showing, you just need to look at this F-18 fighter and 
		the light-armored vehicle behind me.&nbsp; The Army and Marine Corps have 
		been testing this vehicle on a mixture of biofuels.&nbsp; And this Navy 
		fighter jet -- appropriately called the Green Hornet -- will be flown 
		for the first time in just a few days, on Earth Day.&nbsp; If tests go as 
		planned, it will be the first plane ever to fly faster than the speed of 
		sound on a fuel mix that is half biomass.&nbsp; The Air Force is also testing 
		jet engines using biofuels and had the first successful biofuel-powered 
		test flight just last week.&nbsp; I don’t want to drum up any kind of rivalry 
		here, but -- </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the Pentagon isn’t 
		seeking these alternative fuels just to protect our environment; they’re 
		pursuing these homegrown energy sources to protect our national 
		security.&nbsp; Our military leaders recognize the security imperative of 
		increasing the use of alternative fuels, decreasing energy use, reducing 
		our reliance on imported oil, making ourselves more energy-efficient. 
		That’s why the Navy, led by Secretary Mabus, who’s here today, has set a 
		goal of using 50-percent alternative fuels in all planes, vehicles, and 
		ships in the next 10 years.&nbsp; That’s why the Defense Department has 
		invested 2.7 billion dollars this year alone to improve energy 
		efficiency.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So moving towards clean 
		energy is about our security.&nbsp; It’s also about our economy.&nbsp; And it’s 
		about the future of our planet. And what I hope is, is the policies that 
		we’ve laid out -- from hybrid fleets to offshore drilling, from nuclear 
		energy to wind energy -- underscores the seriousness with which my 
		administration takes this challenge.&nbsp; It’s a challenge that requires us 
		to break out of the old ways of thinking, to think and act anew.&nbsp; And it 
		requires each of us, regardless of whether we’re in the private sector 
		or the public sector, whether we’re in the military or in the civilian 
		side of government, to think about how could we be doing things better, 
		how could we be doing things smarter -- so that we are no longer 
		tethered to the whims of what happens somewhere in the Middle East or 
		with other major oil-producing nations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I’m open to proposals 
		from my Democratic friends and my Republican friends.&nbsp; I think that we 
		can break out of the broken politics of the past when it comes to our 
		energy policy.&nbsp; I know that we can come together to pass comprehensive 
		energy and climate legislation that’s going to foster new energy -- new 
		industries, create millions of new jobs, protect our planet, and help us 
		become more energy independent.&nbsp; That’s what we can do.&nbsp; That is what we 
		must do.&nbsp; And I’m confident that is what we will do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So thank you very much.&nbsp; And 
		thanks, again, to all of you who are serving in our Armed Services.&nbsp; You 
		are making an enormous contribution, and this is just one example of the 
		leadership that you’re showing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.</font></p>
