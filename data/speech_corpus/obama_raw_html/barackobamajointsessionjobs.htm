<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice 
		President, members of Congress, and fellow Americans:</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tonight we meet at an urgent 
		time for our country.&nbsp; We continue to face an economic crisis that has 
		left millions of our neighbors jobless, and a political crisis that’s 
		made things worse.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This past week, reporters 
		have been asking, “What will this speech mean for the President?&nbsp; What 
		will it mean for Congress?&nbsp; How will it affect their polls, and the next 
		election?”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the millions of 
		Americans who are watching right now, they don’t care about politics.&nbsp; 
		They have real-life concerns.&nbsp; Many have spent months looking for work.&nbsp; 
		Others are doing their best just to scrape by -- giving up nights out 
		with the family to save on gas or make the mortgage; postponing 
		retirement to send a kid to college.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These men and women grew up 
		with faith in an America where hard work and responsibility paid off.&nbsp; 
		They believed in a country where everyone gets a fair shake and does 
		their fair share -- where if you stepped up, did your job, and were 
		loyal to your company, that loyalty would be rewarded with a decent 
		salary and good benefits; maybe a raise once in a while.&nbsp; If you did the 
		right thing, you could make it.&nbsp; Anybody could make it in America.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For decades now, Americans 
		have watched that compact erode.&nbsp; They have seen the decks too often 
		stacked against them.&nbsp; And they know that Washington has not always put 
		their interests first.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The people of this country 
		work hard to meet their responsibilities.&nbsp; The question tonight is 
		whether we’ll meet ours.&nbsp; The question is whether, in the face of an 
		ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually 
		do something to help the economy.&nbsp; The question is -- the question is 
		whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has 
		defined this nation since our beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those of us here tonight 
		can’t solve all our nation’s woes.&nbsp; Ultimately, our recovery will be 
		driven not by Washington, but by our businesses and our workers.&nbsp; But we 
		can help.&nbsp; We can make a difference.&nbsp; There are steps we can take right 
		now to improve people’s lives.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am sending this Congress a 
		plan that you should pass right away.&nbsp; It’s called the American Jobs 
		Act.&nbsp; There should be nothing controversial about this piece of 
		legislation.&nbsp; Everything in here is the kind of proposal that’s been 
		supported by both Democrats and Republicans -- including many who sit 
		here tonight.&nbsp; And everything in this bill will be paid for.&nbsp; 
		Everything.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The purpose of the American 
		Jobs Act is simple:&nbsp; to put more people back to work and more money in 
		the pockets of those who are working.&nbsp; It will create more jobs for 
		construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, 
		and more jobs for long-term unemployed.&nbsp;It will provide -- it will 
		provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it will cut 
		payroll taxes in half for every working American and every small 
		business.&nbsp;It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled, and 
		give companies confidence that if they invest and if they hire, there 
		will be customers for their products and services.&nbsp; You should pass this 
		jobs plan right away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Everyone here knows that 
		small businesses are where most new jobs begin.&nbsp; And you know that while 
		corporate profits have come roaring back, smaller companies haven’t.&nbsp; So 
		for everyone who speaks so passionately about making life easier for 
		“job creators,” this plan is for you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pass this jobs bill -- pass 
		this jobs bill, and starting tomorrow, small businesses will get a tax 
		cut if they hire new workers or if they raise workers’ wages.&nbsp; Pass this 
		jobs bill, and all small business owners will also see their payroll 
		taxes cut in half next year.&nbsp;If you have 50 employees -- if you have 50 
		employees making an average salary, that’s an $80,000 tax cut.&nbsp; And all 
		businesses will be able to continue writing off the investments they 
		make in 2012.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s not just Democrats who 
		have supported this kind of proposal.&nbsp; Fifty House Republicans have 
		proposed the same payroll tax cut that’s in this plan.&nbsp; You should pass 
		it right away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pass this jobs bill, and we 
		can put people to work rebuilding America.&nbsp; Everyone here knows we have 
		badly decaying roads and bridges all over the country.&nbsp; Our highways are 
		clogged with traffic.&nbsp; Our skies are the most congested in the world.&nbsp; 
		It’s an outrage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Building a world-class 
		transportation system is part of what made us a economic superpower.&nbsp; 
		And now we’re going to sit back and watch China build newer airports and 
		faster railroads?&nbsp; At a time when millions of unemployed construction 
		workers could build them right here in America?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are private 
		construction companies all across America just waiting to get to work.&nbsp; 
		There’s a bridge that needs repair between Ohio and Kentucky that’s on 
		one of the busiest trucking routes in North America.&nbsp; A public transit 
		project in Houston that will help clear up one of the worst areas of 
		traffic in the country.&nbsp; And there are schools throughout this country 
		that desperately need renovating.&nbsp; How can we expect our kids to do 
		their best in places that are literally falling apart?&nbsp; This is 
		America.&nbsp; Every child deserves a great school -- and we can give it to 
		them, if we act now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The American Jobs Act will 
		repair and modernize at least 35,000 schools.&nbsp; It will put people to 
		work right now fixing roofs and windows, installing science labs and 
		high-speed Internet in classrooms all across this country.&nbsp; It will 
		rehabilitate homes and businesses in communities hit hardest by 
		foreclosures.&nbsp; It will jumpstart thousands of transportation projects 
		all across the country.&nbsp; And to make sure the money is properly spent, 
		we’re building on reforms we’ve already put in place.&nbsp; No more 
		earmarks.&nbsp; No more boondoggles.&nbsp; No more bridges to nowhere.&nbsp; We’re 
		cutting the red tape that prevents some of these projects from getting 
		started as quickly as possible.&nbsp; And we’ll set up an independent fund to 
		attract private dollars and issue loans based on two criteria:&nbsp; how 
		badly a construction project is needed and how much good it will do for 
		the economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This idea came from a bill 
		written by a Texas Republican and a Massachusetts Democrat.&nbsp; The idea 
		for a big boost in construction is supported by America’s largest 
		business organization and America’s largest labor organization.&nbsp; It’s 
		the kind of proposal that’s been supported in the past by Democrats and 
		Republicans alike.&nbsp; You should pass it right away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pass this jobs bill, and 
		thousands of teachers in every state will go back to work.&nbsp; These are 
		the men and women charged with preparing our children for a world where 
		the competition has never been tougher.&nbsp; But while they’re adding 
		teachers in places like South Korea, we’re laying them off in droves.&nbsp; 
		It’s unfair to our kids.&nbsp; It undermines their future and ours.&nbsp; And it 
		has to stop.&nbsp; Pass this bill, and put our teachers back in the classroom 
		where they belong.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pass this jobs bill, and 
		companies will get extra tax credits if they hire America’s veterans.&nbsp; 
		We ask these men and women to leave their careers, leave their families, 
		risk their lives to fight for our country.&nbsp; The last thing they should 
		have to do is fight for a job when they come home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pass this bill, and hundreds 
		of thousands of disadvantaged young people will have the hope and the 
		dignity of a summer job next year.&nbsp; And their parents -- their parents, low-income Americans who desperately want to work, will 
		have more ladders out of poverty.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pass this jobs bill, and 
		companies will get a $4,000 tax credit if they hire anyone who has spent 
		more than six months looking for a job.&nbsp;We have to do more to help the 
		long-term unemployed in their search for work.&nbsp; This jobs plan builds on 
		a program in Georgia that several Republican leaders have highlighted, 
		where people who collect unemployment insurance participate in temporary 
		work as a way to build their skills while they look for a permanent 
		job.&nbsp; The plan also extends unemployment insurance for another year.&nbsp;If 
		the millions of unemployed Americans stopped getting this insurance, and 
		stopped using that money for basic necessities, it would be a 
		devastating blow to this economy.&nbsp; Democrats and Republicans in this 
		chamber have supported unemployment insurance plenty of times in the 
		past.&nbsp; And in this time of prolonged hardship, you should pass it again 
		-- right away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pass this jobs bill, and the 
		typical working family will get a $1,500 tax cut next year.&nbsp; Fifteen 
		hundred dollars that would have been taken out of your pocket will go 
		into your pocket.&nbsp; This expands on the tax cut that Democrats and 
		Republicans already passed for this year.&nbsp; If we allow that tax cut to 
		expire -- if we refuse to act -- middle-class families will get hit with 
		a tax increase at the worst possible time.&nbsp; We can’t let that happen.&nbsp; I 
		know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on 
		anyone for as long as you live.&nbsp; Now is not the time to carve out an 
		exception and raise middle-class taxes, which is why you should pass 
		this bill right away.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the American Jobs 
		Act.&nbsp; It will lead to new jobs for construction workers, for teachers, 
		for veterans, for first responders, young people and the long-term 
		unemployed.&nbsp; It will provide tax credits to companies that hire new 
		workers, tax relief to small business owners, and tax cuts for the 
		middle class.&nbsp; And here’s the other thing I want the American people to 
		know:&nbsp;The American Jobs Act will not add to the deficit.&nbsp; It will be 
		paid for.&nbsp; And here’s how.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		The agreement we passed in July will cut government spending by about $1 
		trillion over the next 10 years.&nbsp; It also charges this Congress to come 
		up with an additional $1.5 trillion in savings by Christmas.&nbsp; Tonight, I 
		am asking you to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of 
		the American Jobs Act.&nbsp; And a week from Monday, I’ll be releasing a more 
		ambitious deficit plan -- a plan that will not only cover the cost of 
		this jobs bill, but stabilize our debt in the long run.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This approach is basically 
		the one I’ve been advocating for months.&nbsp; In addition to the trillion 
		dollars of spending cuts I’ve already signed into law, it’s a balanced 
		plan that would reduce the deficit by making additional spending cuts, 
		by making modest adjustments to health care programs like Medicare and 
		Medicaid, and by reforming our tax code in a way that asks the 
		wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair 
		share.&nbsp;What’s more, the spending cuts wouldn’t happen so abruptly that 
		they’d be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from helping small 
		businesses and middle-class families get back on their feet right 
		away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I realize there are 
		some in my party who don’t think we should make any changes at all to 
		Medicare and Medicaid, and I understand their concerns.&nbsp; But here’s the 
		truth:&nbsp; Millions of Americans rely on Medicare in their retirement.&nbsp; And 
		millions more will do so in the future.&nbsp; They pay for this benefit 
		during their working years.&nbsp; They earn it.&nbsp; But with an aging population 
		and rising health care costs, we are spending too fast to sustain the 
		program.&nbsp; And if we don’t gradually reform the system while protecting 
		current beneficiaries, it won’t be there when future retirees need it.&nbsp; 
		We have to reform Medicare to strengthen it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am also -- I’m also well 
		aware that there are many Republicans who don’t believe we should raise 
		taxes on those who are most fortunate and can best afford it.&nbsp; But here 
		is what every American knows:&nbsp; While most people in this country 
		struggle to make ends meet, a few of the most affluent citizens and most 
		profitable corporations enjoy tax breaks and loopholes that nobody else 
		gets.&nbsp; Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his 
		secretary -- an outrage he has asked us to fix.&nbsp; We need a 
		tax code where everyone gets a fair shake and where everybody pays their 
		fair share.&nbsp;And by the way, I believe the vast majority of wealthy 
		Americans and CEOs are willing to do just that if it helps the economy 
		grow and gets our fiscal house in order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’ll also offer ideas to 
		reform a corporate tax code that stands as a monument to special 
		interest influence in Washington.&nbsp; By eliminating pages of loopholes and 
		deductions, we can lower one of the highest corporate tax rates in the 
		world.&nbsp;Our tax code should not give an advantage to companies that can 
		afford the best-connected lobbyists.&nbsp; It should give an advantage to 
		companies that invest and create jobs right here in the United States of 
		America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we can reduce this 
		deficit, pay down our debt, and pay for this jobs plan in the process.&nbsp; 
		But in order to do this, we have to decide what our priorities are.&nbsp; We 
		have to ask ourselves, “What’s the best way to grow the economy and 
		create jobs?”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Should we keep tax loopholes 
		for oil companies?&nbsp; Or should we use that money to give small business 
		owners a tax credit when they hire new workers?&nbsp; Because we can’t afford 
		to do both.&nbsp; Should we keep tax breaks for millionaires and 
		billionaires?&nbsp; Or should we put teachers back to work so our kids can 
		graduate ready for college and good jobs?&nbsp;Right now, we can’t afford to 
		do both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This isn’t political 
		grandstanding.&nbsp; This isn’t class warfare.&nbsp; This is simple math.&nbsp; This is 
		simple math.&nbsp; These are real choices.&nbsp; These are real choices that we’ve 
		got to make.&nbsp; And I’m pretty sure I know what most Americans would 
		choose.&nbsp; It’s not even close.&nbsp; And it’s time for us to do what’s right 
		for our future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the American Jobs Act 
		answers the urgent need to create jobs right away.&nbsp; But we can’t stop 
		there.&nbsp; As I’ve argued since I ran for this office, we have to look 
		beyond the immediate crisis and start building an economy that lasts 
		into the future -- an economy that creates good, middle-class jobs that 
		pay well and offer security.&nbsp; We now live in a world where technology 
		has made it possible for companies to take their business anywhere.&nbsp; If 
		we want them to start here and stay here and hire here, we have to be 
		able to out-build and out-educate and out-innovate every other country 
		on Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this task of making 
		America more competitive for the long haul, that’s a job for all of us.&nbsp; 
		For government and for private companies.&nbsp; For states and for local 
		communities -- and for every American citizen.&nbsp; All of us will have to 
		up our game.&nbsp; All of us will have to change the way we do business.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My administration can and 
		will take some steps to improve our competitiveness on our own.&nbsp; For 
		example, if you’re a small business owner who has a contract with the 
		federal government, we’re going to make sure you get paid a lot faster 
		than you do right now.&nbsp;We’re also planning to cut away the red tape that 
		prevents too many rapidly growing startup companies from raising capital 
		and going public.&nbsp; And to help responsible homeowners, we’re going to 
		work with federal housing agencies to help more people refinance their 
		mortgages at interest rates that are now near 4 percent.&nbsp; That’s a step 
		-- I know you guys must be for this, because that’s a step that can put 
		more than $2,000 a year in a family’s pocket, and give a lift to an 
		economy still burdened by the drop in housing prices.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, some things we can do on 
		our own.&nbsp; Other steps will require congressional action.&nbsp; Today you 
		passed reform that will speed up the outdated patent process, so that 
		entrepreneurs can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as 
		possible. That’s the kind of action we need.&nbsp; Now it’s time to clear the 
		way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for 
		American companies to sell their products in Panama and Colombia and 
		South Korea -– while also helping the workers whose jobs have been 
		affected by global competition.&nbsp;If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, 
		I want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and 
		Chryslers.&nbsp;I want to see more products sold around the world stamped 
		with the three proud words:&nbsp; “Made in America.”&nbsp; That’s what we need to 
		get done.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And on all of our efforts to 
		strengthen competitiveness, we need to look for ways to work side by 
		side with America’s businesses.&nbsp; That’s why I’ve brought together a Jobs 
		Council of leaders from different industries who are developing a wide 
		range of new ideas to help companies grow and create jobs.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Already, we’ve mobilized 
		business leaders to train 10,000 American engineers a year, by providing 
		company internships and training.&nbsp; Other businesses are covering tuition 
		for workers who learn new skills at community colleges.&nbsp; And we’re going 
		to make sure the next generation of manufacturing takes root not in 
		China or Europe, but right here, in the United States of America.&nbsp;If we 
		provide the right incentives, the right support -- and if we make sure 
		our trading partners play by the rules -- we can be the ones to build 
		everything from fuel-efficient cars to advanced biofuels to 
		semiconductors that we sell all around the world.&nbsp; That’s how America 
		can be number one again.&nbsp; And that’s how America will be number one 
		again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I realize that some of 
		you have a different theory on how to grow the economy.&nbsp; Some of you 
		sincerely believe that the only solution to our economic challenges is 
		to simply cut most government spending and eliminate most government 
		regulations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, I agree that we can’t 
		afford wasteful spending, and I’ll work with you, with Congress, to root 
		it out.&nbsp; And I agree that there are some rules and regulations that do 
		put an unnecessary burden on businesses at a time when they can least 
		afford it.&nbsp; That’s why I ordered a review of all government 
		regulations.&nbsp; So far, we’ve identified over 500 reforms, which will save 
		billions of dollars over the next few years.&nbsp; We should have no more 
		regulation than the health, safety and security of the American people 
		require.&nbsp; Every rule should meet that common-sense test.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But what we can’t do -- what 
		I will not do -- is let this economic crisis be used as an excuse to 
		wipe out the basic protections that Americans have counted on for 
		decades. I reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between 
		their jobs and their safety.&nbsp; I reject the argument that says for the 
		economy to grow, we have to roll back protections that ban hidden fees 
		by credit card companies, or rules that keep our kids from being exposed 
		to mercury, or laws that prevent the health insurance industry from 
		shortchanging patients.&nbsp; I reject the idea that we have to strip away 
		collective bargaining rights to compete in a global economy.&nbsp;We shouldn’t be in a race to the bottom, where we try to 
		offer the cheapest labor and the worst pollution standards.&nbsp; America 
		should be in a race to the top.&nbsp; And I believe we can win that race.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact, this larger notion 
		that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle 
		government, refund everybody’s money, and let everyone write their own 
		rules, and tell everyone they’re on their own -- that’s not who we are.&nbsp; 
		That’s not the story of America.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, we are rugged 
		individualists.&nbsp; Yes, we are strong and self-reliant.&nbsp; And it has been 
		the drive and initiative of our workers and entrepreneurs that has made 
		this economy the engine and the envy of the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there’s always been 
		another thread running throughout our history -- a belief that we’re all 
		connected, and that there are some things we can only do together, as a 
		nation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We all remember Abraham 
		Lincoln as the leader who saved our Union.&nbsp; Founder of the Republican 
		Party.&nbsp; But in the middle of a civil war, he was also a leader who 
		looked to the future -- a Republican President who mobilized government 
		to build the Transcontinental Railroad -- launch the National Academy of 
		Sciences, set up the first land grant colleges.&nbsp;And leaders of both 
		parties have followed the example he set.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ask yourselves -- where 
		would we be right now if the people who sat here before us decided not 
		to build our highways, not to build our bridges, our dams, our 
		airports?&nbsp; What would this country be like if we had chosen not to spend 
		money on public high schools, or research universities, or community 
		colleges?&nbsp; Millions of returning heroes, including my grandfather, had 
		the opportunity to go to school because of the G.I. Bill.&nbsp; Where would 
		we be if they hadn’t had that chance?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">How many jobs would it have 
		cost us if past Congresses decided not to support the basic research 
		that led to the Internet and the computer chip?&nbsp; What kind of country 
		would this be if this chamber had voted down Social Security or Medicare 
		just because it violated some rigid idea about what government could or 
		could not do?&nbsp; How many Americans would have suffered as a result?&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No single individual built 
		America on their own.&nbsp; We built it together.&nbsp; We have been, and always 
		will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice 
		for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with 
		responsibilities to one another.&nbsp; And members of Congress, it is time 
		for us to meet our responsibilities.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Every proposal I’ve laid out 
		tonight is the kind that’s been supported by Democrats and Republicans 
		in the past. Every proposal I’ve laid out tonight will be paid for.&nbsp; And 
		every proposal is designed to meet the urgent needs of our people and 
		our communities.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I know there’s been a 
		lot of skepticism about whether the politics of the moment will allow us 
		to pass this jobs plan -- or any jobs plan.&nbsp; Already, we’re seeing the 
		same old press releases and tweets flying back and forth.&nbsp; Already, the 
		media has proclaimed that it’s impossible to bridge our differences.&nbsp; 
		And maybe some of you have decided that those differences are so great 
		that we can only resolve them at the ballot box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But know this:&nbsp; The next 
		election is 14 months away.&nbsp; And the people who sent us here -- the 
		people who hired us to work for them -- they don’t have the luxury of 
		waiting 14 months.&nbsp;Some of them are living week to week, paycheck to 
		paycheck, even day to day.&nbsp; They need help, and they need it now.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t pretend that this 
		plan will solve all our problems. It should not be, nor will it be, the 
		last plan of action we propose.&nbsp; What’s guided us from the start of this 
		crisis hasn’t been the search for a silver bullet.&nbsp; It’s been a 
		commitment to stay at it -- to be persistent -- to keep trying every new 
		idea that works, and listen to every good proposal, no matter which 
		party comes up with it.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Regardless of the arguments 
		we’ve had in the past, regardless of the arguments we will have in the 
		future, this plan is the right thing to do right now.&nbsp;You should pass 
		it.&nbsp; And I intend to take that message to every corner of this 
		country.&nbsp;And I ask -- I ask every American who agrees to lift your 
		voice:&nbsp; Tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want 
		action now.&nbsp; Tell Washington that doing nothing is not an option.&nbsp; 
		Remind us that if we act as one nation and one people, we have it within 
		our power to meet this challenge.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">President Kennedy once said, 
		“Our problems are man-made -- therefore they can be solved by man.&nbsp; And 
		man can be as big as he wants.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are difficult years 
		for our country.&nbsp; But we are Americans.&nbsp; We are tougher than the times 
		we live in, and we are bigger than our politics have been.&nbsp; So let’s 
		meet the moment.&nbsp; Let’s get to work, and let’s show the world once again 
		why the United States of America remains the greatest nation on Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much.&nbsp; God 
		bless you, and God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
