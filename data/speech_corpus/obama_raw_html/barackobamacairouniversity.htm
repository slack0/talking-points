<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY 
CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from audio] </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much. Good afternoon. I am honored to be in the timeless city of Cairo, 
		and to be hosted by two remarkable institutions. For over a 
		thousand years, Al-Azhar has stood as a beacon of Islamic learning; and 
		for over a century, Cairo University has been a source of Egypt's 
		advancement.&nbsp;And together, you represent the harmony between 
		tradition and progress.&nbsp;I'm grateful for your hospitality and the 
		hospitality of the people of Egypt. And I'm also proud to carry with me 
		the goodwill of the American people, and a greeting of peace from Muslim 
		communities in my country:&nbsp;Assalaamu alaykum [Peace be 
		upon you].</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We meet at a time of great 
		tension between the United States and Muslims around the world, 
		tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy 
		debate.&nbsp;The relationship between Islam and the West includes 
		centuries of coexistence and cooperation, but also conflict and 
		religious wars. More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism 
		that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in 
		which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies 
		without regard to their own aspirations.&nbsp;Moreover, the sweeping 
		change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view 
		the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Violent extremists have 
		exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority of Muslims.&nbsp;The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the continued efforts of these 
		extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my 
		country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and 
		Western countries, but also to human rights.&nbsp;All this has bred 
		more fear and more mistrust.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So long as our relationship 
		is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred 
		rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the 
		cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and 
		prosperity. And this cycle of suspicion and discord must end.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've come here to Cairo to 
		seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the 
		world, one based on mutual interest and mutual respect, and one based 
		upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be 
		in competition.&nbsp;Instead, they overlap and share common principles 
		-- principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all 
		human beings.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I do so recognizing that 
		change cannot happen overnight. I know there's been a lot of 
		publicity about this speech, but no single speech can eradicate years of 
		mistrust, nor can I answer in the time that I have this afternoon all 
		the complex questions that brought us to this point.&nbsp;But I am 
		convinced that in order to move forward, we must say openly to each 
		other the things we hold in our hearts and that too often are said only 
		behind closed doors. There must be a sustained effort to listen to 
		each other, to learn from each other, to respect one another, and to 
		seek common ground.&nbsp;As the Holy Qur’an tells us, &quot;Be conscious of 
		God and speak always the truth.&quot; That is what I will try to do today -- 
		to speak the truth as best I can, humbled by the task before us, and 
		firm in my belief that the interests we share as human beings are far 
		more powerful than the forces that drive us apart.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now part of this conviction 
		is rooted in my own experience. I'm a Christian, but my father came from 
		a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims.&nbsp; As a boy, I 
		spent several years in Indonesia and heard the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhan"><font color="#0000FF">call 
		of the azaan</font></a> at the break of dawn and at the fall of dusk.&nbsp; 
		As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity 
		and peace in their Muslim faith.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a student of history, I 
		also know civilization's debt to Islam.&nbsp;It was Islam -- at places 
		like Al-Azhar -- that carried the light of learning through so many 
		centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment.&nbsp;It was innovation in Muslim communities -- 
		It was innovation in Muslim 
		communities that developed the order of algebra, our magnetic compass 
		and tools of navigation, our mastery of pens and printing, our 
		understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed.&nbsp;Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; 
		timeless poetry and cherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of 
		peaceful contemplation.&nbsp;And throughout history, Islam has 
		demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious 
		tolerance and racial equality.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also know that Islam has 
		always been a part of America's story.&nbsp;The first nation to 
		recognize my country was Morocco.&nbsp;In signing the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli">
		<font color="#0000FF">Treaty of Tripoli</font></a> 
		in 1796, our second President, John Adams, wrote, &quot;The United States has 
		in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or 
		tranquility of Muslims.&quot;&nbsp;And since our founding, American Muslims 
		have enriched the United States.&nbsp;They have fought in our wars; 
		they have served in our government; they have stood for civil rights; 
		they have started businesses; they have taught at our universities; 
		they've excelled in our sports arenas; they've won Nobel Prizes, built 
		our tallest building, and lit the Olympic Torch.&nbsp; And when the 
		first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath 
		to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Qur’an that one of our 
		Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson -- kept in his personal library.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I have known Islam on 
		three continents before coming to the region where it was first 
		revealed. That experience guides my conviction that partnership 
		between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is, not what it 
		isn't.&nbsp;And I consider it part of my responsibility as President of 
		the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam 
		wherever they appear.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But, that same principle must 
		apply to Muslim perceptions of America. Just as Muslims -- Just as 
		Muslims do not fit a 
		crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a 
		self-interested empire.&nbsp;The United States has been one of the 
		greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known.&nbsp;We 
		were born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded 
		upon the ideal that all are created equal. And we have shed blood and 
		struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our 
		borders and around the world.&nbsp;We are shaped by every culture, 
		drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept:&nbsp;E pluribus unum -- &quot;Out of many, one.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now much has been made of 
		the fact that an African American with the name Barack Hussein Obama 
		could be elected President. But my personal story is not so unique.&nbsp;The dream of opportunity for all people has not come true for everyone 
		in America, but its promise exists for all who come to our shores -- and 
		that includes nearly 7 million American Muslims in our country today 
		who, by the way, enjoy incomes and educational levels that are higher 
		than the American average.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, freedom in America 
		is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion.&nbsp;That 
		is why there is a mosque in every state in our union, and over 1200 
		mosques within our borders.&nbsp; That's why the United States 
		government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to 
		wear the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab">
		<font color="#0000FF">hijab</font></a> -- and to punish those who would deny it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So let there be no doubt 
		-- let there be no doubt: 
		Islam is a part of America.&nbsp;And I believe that America holds 
		within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in 
		life, all of us share common aspirations -- to live in peace and 
		security; to get an education and to work with dignity; to love our 
		families, our communities, and our God. These things we share.&nbsp;This is the hope of all humanity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, recognizing our 
		common humanity is only the beginning of our task.&nbsp;Words alone 
		cannot meet the needs of our people.&nbsp;These needs will be met only 
		if we act boldly in the years ahead, and if we understand that the 
		challenges we face are shared and our failure to meet them will hurt us 
		all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For we have learned from 
		recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, 
		prosperity is hurt everywhere.&nbsp;When a new flu infects one human 
		being, all are at risk.&nbsp; When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, 
		the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations.&nbsp; When violent 
		extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered 
		across an ocean.&nbsp;When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are 
		slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience.&nbsp;That is 
		what it means to share this world in the 21st century.&nbsp;That is the 
		responsibility we have to one another as human beings.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is a difficult 
		responsibility to embrace.&nbsp;For human history has often been a 
		record of nations and tribes -- and, yes, religions -- subjugating one 
		another in pursuit of their own interests.&nbsp;Yet in this new age, 
		such attitudes are self-defeating.&nbsp;Given our interdependence, any 
		world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another 
		will inevitably fail.&nbsp;So whatever we think of the past, we must 
		not be prisoners to it.&nbsp;Our problems must be dealt with through 
		partnership; our progress must be shared. Now, that does not mean we 
		should ignore sources of tension. Indeed, it suggests the opposite:&nbsp; 
		We must face these tensions squarely. And so in that spirit, let 
		me speak as clearly and as plainly as I can about some specific issues 
		that I believe we must finally confront together.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first issue that we have 
		to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Ankara, I made clear that 
		America is not -- and never will be -- at war with Islam. We will, 
		however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave 
		threat to our security -- because we reject the same thing that people 
		of all faiths reject:&nbsp;the killing of innocent men, women, and 
		children.&nbsp;And it is my first duty as President to protect the 
		American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The situation in Afghanistan 
		demonstrates America's goals, and our need to work together.&nbsp;Over 
		seven years ago, the United States pursued al Qaeda and the Taliban with 
		broad international support.&nbsp;We did not go by choice; we went 
		because of necessity. I'm aware that there's still some who would 
		question or even justify the events of 9/11.&nbsp;But let us be clear:&nbsp;Al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day.&nbsp;The victims were 
		innocent men, women, and children from America and many other nations who 
		had done nothing to harm anybody.&nbsp;And yet al Qaeda chose to 
		ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even 
		now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. They 
		have affiliates in many countries and are trying to expand their reach. These are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, make no mistake:&nbsp;We do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan.&nbsp;We see no 
		military -- We seek no military bases there. It is agonizing for 
		America to lose our young men and women.&nbsp; It is costly and 
		politically difficult to continue this conflict.&nbsp;We would gladly 
		bring every single one of our troops home if we could be confident that 
		there were not violent extremists in Afghanistan and now Pakistan 
		determined to kill as many Americans as they possibly can.&nbsp;But 
		that is not yet the case.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that's why we're 
		partnering with a coalition of 46 countries.&nbsp;And despite the costs 
		involved, America's commitment will not weaken.&nbsp;Indeed, none of us 
		should tolerate these extremists.&nbsp; They have killed in many 
		countries.&nbsp;They have killed people of different faiths. But more 
		than any other, they have killed Muslims.&nbsp;Their actions are 
		irreconcilable with the rights of human beings, the progress of nations, 
		and with Islam.&nbsp;The Qur’an teaches that whoever kills an 
		innocent is as -- it is as if he has killed all mankind. And the Holy 
		Qur’an also says whoever -- whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all 
		mankind. The enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger 
		than the narrow hatred of a few. Islam is not part of the problem in 
		combating violent extremism -- it is an important part of promoting 
		peace.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we also know that 
		military power alone is not going to solve the problems in Afghanistan 
		and Pakistan.&nbsp;That's why we plan to invest 1.5 billion dollars each year 
		over the next five years to partner with Pakistanis to build schools and 
		hospitals, roads and businesses, and hundreds of millions to help those 
		who've been displaced.&nbsp;That's why we are providing more than 2.8 
		billion dollars to help Afghans develop their economy and deliver services that 
		people depend on.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me also address the 
		issue of Iraq.&nbsp;Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice that 
		provoked strong differences in my country and around the world.&nbsp;Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off 
		without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in 
		Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build 
		international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. 
		Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said:&nbsp;&quot;I 
		hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the 
		less we use our power the greater it will be.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, America has a dual 
		responsibility:&nbsp;to help Iraq forge a better future; and to leave 
		Iraq to Iraqis.&nbsp;And I have made it clear to the Iraqi people -- I 
		have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no 
		claim on their territory or resources.&nbsp;Iraq's sovereignty is its 
		own. And that's why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next 
		August.&nbsp;That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's 
		democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi 
		cities by July, and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012. We 
		will help Iraq train its security forces and develop its economy.&nbsp;But we will support a secure and united Iraq as a partner, and never as 
		a patron.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, just as America 
		can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter or forget 
		our principles. Nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country. 
		The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some 
		cases it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals.&nbsp;We are taking concrete actions to change course.&nbsp;I have 
		unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I 
		have 
		<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/barackobama/barackobamajointsession2009.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed</font></a> by early next year. So America will defend 
		itself, respectful of the sovereignty of nations and the rule of law.&nbsp;And we will do so in partnership with Muslim communities which are also 
		threatened.&nbsp;The sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome 
		in Muslim communities, the sooner we will all be safer.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second major source of 
		tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis, 
		Palestinians, and the Arab world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America's strong bonds with 
		Israel are well known.&nbsp;This bond is unbreakable. It is based 
		upon cultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the 
		aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that 
		cannot be denied.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Around the world, the Jewish 
		people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism in Europe 
		culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust.&nbsp;Tomorrow, I will visit 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchenwald"><font color="#0000FF">Buchenwald</font></a>, which was part of a network of camps where Jews were 
		enslaved, tortured, shot, and gassed to death by the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reich">
		<font color="#0000FF">Third Reich</font></a>.&nbsp;Six million Jews were killed -- more than the entire Jewish population 
		of Israel today. Denying that fact is baseless; it is ignorant; 
		and it is hateful.&nbsp;Threatening Israel with destruction, or 
		repeating vile stereotypes about Jews, is deeply wrong and only 
		serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memories 
		while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other hand, it is 
		also undeniable that the Palestinian people -- Muslims and Christians -- 
		has suffered in pursuit of a homeland.&nbsp;For more than 60 years 
		they've endured the pain of dislocation.&nbsp;Many wait in refugee 
		camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace 
		and security that they have never been able to lead.&nbsp;They endure 
		the daily humiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation.&nbsp;So let there be no doubt:&nbsp;The situation for the Palestinian people 
		is intolerable.&nbsp;And America will not turn our backs on the 
		legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state 
		of their own.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For decades then, there has 
		been a stalemate:&nbsp;two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each 
		with a painful history that makes compromise elusive.&nbsp;It's easy to 
		point fingers -- for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought 
		about by Israel's founding, and for Israelis to point to the constant 
		hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as 
		well as beyond. But if we see this conflict only from one side or 
		the other, then we will be blind to the truth: The only resolution 
		is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where 
		Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is in Israel's 
		interest, Palestine's interest, America's interest, and the world's 
		interest. And that is why I intend to personally pursue this 
		outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task requires. The 
		obligations -- The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the 
		road map are clear. For peace to come, it is time for them -- and 
		all of us -- to live up to our responsibilities.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Palestinians must abandon 
		violence.&nbsp;Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and it 
		does not succeed.&nbsp;For centuries, black people in America suffered 
		the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation.&nbsp;But it was not violence that won full and equal rights.&nbsp;It was a 
		peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of 
		America's founding.&nbsp;This same story can be told by people from 
		South Africa to South Asia; from Eastern Europe to Indonesia.&nbsp;It's 
		a story with a simple truth:&nbsp;Violence is a dead end.&nbsp;It 
		is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping 
		children, or to blow up old women on a bus.&nbsp;That's not how moral 
		authority is claimed; that's how it is surrendered.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now is the time for 
		Palestinians to focus on what they can build.&nbsp;The Palestinian 
		Authority must develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that 
		serve the needs of its peoples. Hamas does have support among some 
		Palestinians, but they also have to recognize they have 
		responsibilities.&nbsp;To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian 
		aspirations, to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to 
		violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time, Israelis 
		must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, 
		neither can Palestine's.&nbsp;The United States does not accept the 
		legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. This construction violates 
		previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace.&nbsp;It is 
		time for these settlements to stop.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And Israel must also live up 
		to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work and 
		develop their society.&nbsp;Just as it devastates Palestinian families, 
		the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's 
		security; neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West 
		Bank. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a 
		critical part of a road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to 
		enable such progress.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, the Arab states 
		must recognize that the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Peace_Initiative">
		<font color="#0000FF">Arab Peace Initiative</font></a> was an important 
		beginning, but not the end of their responsibilities.&nbsp;The 
		Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of 
		Arab nations from other problems.&nbsp;Instead, it must be a cause for 
		action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will 
		sustain their state, to recognize Israel's legitimacy, and to choose 
		progress over a self-defeating focus on the past.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America will align our 
		policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what we 
		say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs. We cannot impose 
		peace.&nbsp;But privately, many Muslims recognize that Israel will not 
		go away.&nbsp;Likewise, many Israelis recognize the need for a 
		Palestinian state.&nbsp;It is time for us to act on what everyone knows 
		to be true.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Too many tears have been 
		shed.&nbsp;Too much blood has been shed.&nbsp;All of us have a 
		responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and 
		Palestinians can see their children grow up without fear; when the Holy 
		Land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended 
		it to be; when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and 
		Christians and Muslims, and a place for all of the children of Abraham 
		to mingle peacefully together as in the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isra_and_Mi'raj#The_story">
		<font color="#0000FF">story of Isra</font></a> -- as in the story 
		of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, peace be upon them, joined in 
		prayer.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The third source of tension 
		is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on 
		nuclear weapons.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This issue has been a source 
		of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.&nbsp;For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my 
		country, and there is in fact a tumultuous history between us.&nbsp;In 
		the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the 
		overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.&nbsp;Since 
		the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking 
		and violence against U.S. troops and civilians.&nbsp;This history is 
		well known.&nbsp;Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it 
		clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move 
		forward.&nbsp;The question now is not what Iran is against, but rather 
		what future it wants to build.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I recognize it will be hard 
		to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage, 
		rectitude, and resolve.&nbsp;There will be many issues to discuss 
		between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without 
		preconditions on the basis of mutual respect.&nbsp;But it is clear to 
		all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a 
		decisive point.&nbsp;This is not simply about America's interests.&nbsp;It's about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could 
		lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I understand those who 
		protest that some countries have weapons that others do not.&nbsp;No 
		single nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons. 
		And that's why I strongly reaffirmed America's commitment to seek a 
		world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons.&nbsp; And any nation -- 
		including Iran -- should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power 
		if it complies with its responsibilities under the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty">
		<font color="#0000FF">Nuclear 
		Non-Proliferation Treaty</font></a>.&nbsp;That commitment is at the core of the 
		treaty, and it must be kept for all who fully abide by it. And I am 
		hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The fourth issue that I will 
		address is democracy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know -- I know there has 
		been controversy about the promotion of democracy in recent years, and 
		much of this controversy is connected to the war in Iraq.&nbsp;So let 
		me be clear: No system of government can or should be imposed by one 
		nation by any other.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect 
		the will of the people.&nbsp;Each nation gives life to this principle 
		in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people.&nbsp;America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we 
		would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election.&nbsp;But 
		I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things:&nbsp;the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; 
		confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; 
		government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the 
		freedom to live as you choose.&nbsp;These are not just American ideas; 
		they are human rights. And that is why we will support them 
		everywhere.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there is no straight 
		line to realize this promise.&nbsp;But this much is clear:&nbsp;Governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, 
		successful, and secure.&nbsp;Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making 
		them go away. America -- America respects the right of all peaceful and 
		law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree 
		with them.&nbsp;And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments 
		-- provided they govern with respect for all their people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This last point is important 
		because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they're out 
		of power. Once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of 
		others.&nbsp;So no matter where it takes hold, government of the people 
		and by the people sets a single standard for all who would hold power:&nbsp;You must maintain your power through consent, not coercion; you must 
		respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of 
		tolerance and compromise; you must place the interests of your people 
		and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party. 
		Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you. The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Islam has a proud tradition 
		of tolerance.&nbsp;We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba 
		during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition">
		<font color="#0000FF">Inquisition</font></a>.&nbsp;I saw it firsthand as a child in 
		Indonesia, where devout Christians worshiped freely in an overwhelmingly 
		Muslim country.&nbsp;That is the spirit we need today.&nbsp;People in 
		every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon 
		the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul.&nbsp;This 
		tolerance is essential for religion to thrive, but it's being challenged 
		in many different ways.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Among some Muslims, there's 
		a disturbing tendency to measure one's own faith by the rejection of 
		somebody else's faith.&nbsp;The richness of religious diversity must be 
		upheld -- whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt. 
		And if we are being honest, fault lines must be closed among Muslims, as 
		well, as the divisions between Sunni and Shia have led to tragic 
		violence, particularly in Iraq.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Freedom of religion is 
		central to the ability of peoples to live together.&nbsp;We must always 
		examine the ways in which we protect it.&nbsp;For instance, in the 
		United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for 
		Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation.&nbsp;That's why I'm 
		committed to working with American Muslims to ensure that they can 
		fulfill <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat">
		<font color="#0000FF">zakat</font></a>. Likewise, it is important for 
		Western countries to avoid impeding Muslim citizens from practicing 
		religion as they see fit -- for instance, by dictating what clothes a 
		Muslim woman should wear. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can't disguise hostility towards any 
		religion behind the pretence of liberalism. <br>
		&nbsp; <br>
		In fact, faith should bring us together.&nbsp;And that's why we're 
		forging service projects in America to bring together Christians, 
		Muslims, and Jews.&nbsp;That's why we welcome efforts like Saudi 
		Arabian King Abdullah's interfaith dialogue and Turkey's leadership in 
		the <a href="http://www.unaoc.org/"><font color="#0000FF">Alliance of Civilizations</font></a>.&nbsp;Around the world, we can turn 
		dialogue into interfaith service, so bridges between peoples lead to 
		action -- whether it is combating malaria in Africa, or providing relief 
		after a natural disaster.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The sixth issue -- The sixth 
		issue that I want to address is women's rights.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know --- I know -- and 
		you can tell from this audience, that there is a healthy debate about 
		this issue.&nbsp;I reject the view of some in the West that a woman who 
		chooses to cover her hair is somehow less equal, but I do believe that a 
		woman who is denied an education is denied equality. And it is no 
		coincidence that countries where women are well educated are far more 
		likely to be prosperous. Now, let me be clear:&nbsp;Issues of women's equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam.&nbsp;In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, we've seen Muslim-majority 
		countries elect a woman to lead.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the struggle for 
		women's equality continues in many aspects of American life, and in 
		countries around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am convinced that our 
		daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons.&nbsp;Our 
		common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity -- men and 
		women -- to reach their full potential.&nbsp;I do not believe that 
		women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal, and I 
		respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles. 
		But it should be their choice. And that is why the United States 
		will partner with any Muslim-majority country to support expanded 
		literacy for girls, and to help young women pursue employment through 
		micro-financing that helps people live their dreams.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, I want to discuss 
		economic development and opportunity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that for many, the 
		face of globalization is contradictory.&nbsp;The Internet and 
		television can bring knowledge and information, but also offensive 
		sexuality and mindless violence into the home.&nbsp;Trade can bring new 
		wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions and change in 
		communities.&nbsp;In all nations -- including America -- this change 
		can bring fear;&nbsp;fear that because of modernity we lose control 
		over our economic choices, our politics, and most importantly our 
		identities -- those things we most cherish about our communities, our 
		families, our traditions, and our faith.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But I also know that human 
		progress cannot be denied.&nbsp;There need not be contradictions 
		between development and tradition. Countries like Japan and South Korea 
		grew their economies enormously while maintaining distinct cultures.&nbsp;The same is true for the astonishing progress within Muslim-majority 
		countries from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai.&nbsp;In ancient times and in our 
		times, Muslim communities have been at the forefront of innovation and 
		education.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And this is important because no development strategy can be based only 
		upon what comes out of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young 
		people are out of work.&nbsp;Many Gulf states have enjoyed great wealth 
		as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus it on broader 
		development.&nbsp;But all of us must recognize that education and 
		innovation will be the currency of the 21st century -- and in too -- and 
		in too many 
		Muslim communities, there remains underinvestment in these areas.&nbsp;I'm emphasizing such investment within my own country.&nbsp;And while 
		America in the past has focused on oil and gas when it comes to this 
		part of the world, we now seek a broader engagement.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On education, we will expand 
		exchange programs, and increase scholarships, like the one that brought 
		my father to America. At the same time, we will encourage more Americans 
		to study in Muslim communities. And we will match promising Muslim 
		students with internships in America, invest in online learning for 
		teachers and children around the world, and create a new online network, 
		so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a young 
		person in Cairo.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On economic development, we 
		will create a new corps of business volunteers to partner with 
		counterparts in Muslim-majority countries.&nbsp;And I will host a 
		summit on entrepreneurship this year to identify how we can deepen ties 
		between business leaders, foundations, and social entrepreneurs in the 
		United States and Muslim communities around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On science and technology, 
		we will launch a new fund to support technological development in 
		Muslim-majority countries, and to help transfer ideas to -- to the marketplace 
		so they can create more jobs.&nbsp;We'll open centers of scientific 
		excellence in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and appoint 
		new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources 
		of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new 
		crops.&nbsp;Today I'm announcing a new global effort with the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_the_Islamic_Conference">
		<font color="#0000FF">Organization of the Islamic Conference</font></a> to eradicate polio.&nbsp;And we 
		will also expand partnerships with Muslim communities to promote child 
		and maternal health.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All these things must be 
		done in partnership.&nbsp;Americans are ready to join with citizens and 
		governments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses 
		in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a 
		better life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now the issues that I have 
		described will not be easy to address.&nbsp;But we have a 
		responsibility to join together on behalf of the world that we seek -- a 
		world where extremists no longer threaten our people, and American 
		troops have come home; a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each 
		secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used for peaceful 
		purposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights 
		of all God's children are respected.&nbsp;Those are mutual interests.&nbsp;That is the world we seek.&nbsp;But we can only achieve it together.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know there are many, 
		Muslim and non-Muslim, who question whether we can forge this new 
		beginning.&nbsp;Some are eager to stoke the flames of division, and to 
		stand in the way of progress.&nbsp; Some suggest that it isn't worth the 
		effort -- that we are fated to disagree, and civilizations are doomed to 
		clash. Many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur.&nbsp;There's so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years.&nbsp;But if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in 
		every country: You, more than anyone, have the ability to reimagine 
		the world, to remake this world. All of us share this world 
		for but a brief moment in time. The question is whether we spend that 
		time focused on what pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to 
		an effort -- a sustained effort -- to find common ground, to focus on 
		the future we seek for our children, and to respect the dignity of all 
		human beings.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's easier to start wars 
		than to end them.&nbsp;It's easier to blame others than to look inward.&nbsp;It's easier to see what is different about someone than to find the 
		things we share.&nbsp;But we should choose the right path, not just the 
		easy path.&nbsp;There's one rule that lies at the heart of every 
		religion -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. 
		This truth transcends nations and peoples -- a belief that isn't new; 
		that isn't black or white or brown; that isn't Christian or Muslim or 
		Jew.&nbsp;It's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and 
		that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world.&nbsp;It's 
		a faith in other people, and it's what brought me here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have the power to make 
		the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make a new 
		beginning, keeping in mind what has been written.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Holy Qur’an tells us:&nbsp;&quot;O mankind! We have created you male and a female; and we have 
		made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Talmud tells us: 
		&quot;The whole of the Torah is for the purpose of promoting peace.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Holy Bible tells us: 
		&quot;<a href="../sermononthemount.html"><font color="#0000FF">Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God</font></a>.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The people of the world can 
		live together in peace. We know that is God's vision.&nbsp;Now 
		that must be our work here on Earth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp;And may 
		God's peace be upon you. Thank you very much. Thank you.</font></p>
