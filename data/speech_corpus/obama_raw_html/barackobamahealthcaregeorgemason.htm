transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Hello, George Mason!&nbsp;How’s 
		everybody doing today?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes we can!&nbsp; Yes 
		we can!&nbsp; Yes we can!&nbsp; Yes we can!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Thank you, 
		everybody.&nbsp; It’s good to be back with some real Patriots.&nbsp; I want to 
		thank Dr. Alan Merten, the President of George Mason University, and his 
		family. Dr. Shirley Travis, who’s here -- thank you.&nbsp; And Coach 
		Larranaga, we were just talking a little bit about -- looking forward to 
		picking George Mason in my bracket next year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; We love 
		you!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; I love 
		you!&nbsp;I don’t know if some of you remember, but I visited this university 
		about three years ago for the first time.&nbsp; This was at just the dawn of 
		my presidential campaign.&nbsp; It was about three weeks old, I think.&nbsp; We 
		didn’t have a lot of money.&nbsp; We didn’t have a lot of staff.&nbsp; Nobody 
		could pronounce my name.&nbsp;Our poll numbers were quite low.&nbsp; And a lot of 
		people -- a lot of people in Washington, they didn’t think it was even 
		worth us trying.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; Yes we 
		can!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; They had 
		counted us out before we had even started, because the Washington 
		conventional wisdom was that change was too hard.&nbsp; But what we had even 
		then was a group of students here at George Mason -- who believed that 
		if we worked hard enough and if we fought long enough, if we organized 
		enough supporters, then we could finally bring change to that city 
		across the river.&nbsp; We believed that despite all the resistance, we could 
		make Washington work.&nbsp; Not for the lobbyists, not for the special 
		interests, not for the politicians, but for the American people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And now three years later, I 
		stand before you, one year after the worst recession since the Great 
		Depression, having to make a bunch of tough decisions, having had a 
		tumultuous debate, having had a lot of folks who were skeptical that we 
		could get anything done.&nbsp; And right now, we are at the point where we 
		are going to do something historic this weekend.&nbsp; That’s what this 
		health care vote is all about.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes we can!&nbsp; Yes 
		we can!&nbsp; Yes we can!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; A few miles 
		from here, Congress is in the final stages of a fateful debate about the 
		future of health insurance in America.&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a debate that’s raged 
		not just for the past year but for the past century.&nbsp; One thing when 
		you’re in the White House, you’ve got a lot of history books around 
		you.&nbsp; And so I’ve been reading up on the history here.&nbsp; Teddy Roosevelt, 
		Republican, was the first to advocate that everybody get health care in 
		this country.&nbsp;Every decade since, we’ve had Presidents, Republicans and 
		Democrats, from Harry Truman to Richard Nixon to JFK to Lyndon Johnson 
		to -- every single President has said we need to fix this system.&nbsp; It’s 
		a debate that’s not only about the cost of health care, not just about 
		what we’re doing about folks who aren’t getting a fair shake from their 
		insurance companies.&nbsp; It’s a debate about the character of our country-- 
		about whether we can still meet the challenges of our time; whether we 
		still have the guts and the courage to give every citizen, not just 
		some, the chance to reach their dreams.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">At the heart of this debate 
		is the question of whether we’re going to accept a system that works 
		better for the insurance companies than it does for the American people 
		-- because if this vote fails, the insurance industry will continue to 
		run amok.&nbsp; They will continue to deny people coverage.&nbsp; They will 
		continue to deny people care.&nbsp; They will continue to jack up premiums 40 
		or 50 or 60 percent as they have in the last few weeks without any 
		accountability whatsoever.&nbsp; They know this.&nbsp; And that’s why their 
		lobbyists are stalking the halls of Congress as we speak, and pouring 
		millions of dollars into negative ads.&nbsp; And that’s why they are doing 
		everything they can to kill this bill.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So the only question left is 
		this:&nbsp; Are we going to let the special interests win once again?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">AUDIENCE:&nbsp; No!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Or are we 
		going to make this vote a victory for the American people? </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">AUDIENCE:&nbsp; Yes we can!&nbsp; Yes 
		we can!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; George 
		Mason, the time for reform is right now.&nbsp; Not a year from now, not five 
		years from now, not 10 years from now, not 20 years from now -- it’s 
		now.&nbsp; We have had -- we have had a year of hard debate.&nbsp; Every proposal 
		has been put on the table.&nbsp; Every argument has been made.&nbsp; We have 
		incorporated the best ideas from Democrats and from Republicans into a 
		final proposal that builds on the system of private insurance that we 
		currently have.&nbsp; The insurance industry and its supporters in Congress 
		have tried to portray this as radical change.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, I just -- I just want 
		to be clear, everybody.&nbsp; Listen up, because we have heard every crazy 
		thing about this bill.&nbsp; You remember.&nbsp; First we heard this was a 
		government takeover of health care.&nbsp; Then we heard that this was going 
		to kill granny.&nbsp; Then we heard, well, illegal immigrants are going to be 
		getting the main benefits of this bill.&nbsp; There has been -- they have 
		thrown every argument at this legislative effort.&nbsp; But when it -- it 
		turns out, at the end of the day, what we’re talking about is 
		common-sense reform.&nbsp; That’s all we’re talking about. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">If you like your doctor, 
		you’re going to be able to keep your doctor.&nbsp; If you like your plan, 
		keep your plan.&nbsp; I don’t believe we should give government or the 
		insurance companies more control over health care in America.&nbsp; I think 
		it’s time to give you, the American people, more control over your 
		health.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And since you’ve been 
		hearing a whole bunch of nonsense, let’s just be clear on what exactly 
		the proposal that they’re going to vote on in a couple of days will do.&nbsp; 
		It’s going to -- it’s going to change health care in three ways.&nbsp; Number 
		one, we are going to end the worst practices of insurance companies.&nbsp; 
		This is -- this is a patient’s bill of rights on steroids.&nbsp; Starting 
		this year, thousands of uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions 
		will be able to purchase health insurance, some for the very first 
		time.&nbsp;Starting this year, insurance companies will be banned forever 
		from denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions.&nbsp; Starting 
		this year, insurance companies will be banned from dropping your 
		coverage when you get sick.&nbsp; And they’ve been spending a 
		lot of time weeding out people who are sick so they don’t have to pay 
		benefits that people have already paid for.&nbsp; Those practices will end.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">If this reform becomes law, 
		all new insurance plans will be required to offer free preventive care 
		to their customers.&nbsp;If you buy a new plan, there won’t be lifetime or 
		restrictive annual limits on the amount of care you receive from your 
		insurance companies.&nbsp; And by the way, to all the young people here 
		today, starting this year if you don’t have insurance, all new plans 
		will allow you to stay on your parents’ plan until you are 26 years old.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So you’ll have some security 
		when you graduate.&nbsp; If that first job doesn’t offer coverage, you’re 
		going to know that you’ve got coverage.&nbsp; Because as you start your lives 
		and your careers, the last thing you should be worried about is whether 
		you’re going to go broke or make your parents broke just because you get 
		sick.&nbsp; All right?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So that’s the first thing 
		this legislation does -- the toughest insurance reforms in history.&nbsp; And 
		by the way, when you talk to Republicans and you say, well, are you 
		against this?&nbsp; A lot of them will say, no, no, that part’s okay.&nbsp;All 
		right, so let’s go to the second part.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The second thing that would 
		change about the current system is that for the first time, small 
		business owners and people who are being priced out of the insurance 
		market will have the same kind of choice of private health insurance 
		that members of Congress give to themselves.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So what this means is, is 
		that small business owners and middle-class families, they’re going to 
		be able to be part of what’s called a big pool of customers that can 
		negotiate with the insurance companies.&nbsp; And that means they can 
		purchase more affordable coverage in a competitive marketplace.&nbsp;So 
		they’re not out there on their own just shopping.&nbsp; They’re part of 
		millions of people who are shopping together.&nbsp; And if you still can’t 
		afford the insurance in this new marketplace, even though it’s going to 
		be cheaper than what you can get on your own, then we’re going to offer 
		you tax credits to help you afford it -– tax credits that add up to the 
		largest middle-class tax cut for health care in American history. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, these tax credits cost 
		money.&nbsp; Helping folks who can’t afford it right now, that does cost some 
		money.&nbsp; It costs about $100 billion per year.&nbsp; But most of the cost --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">AUDIENCE MEMBER:&nbsp; That’s all 
		right.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; Well, here’s 
		the reason it’s all right.&nbsp;Here’s the reason it’s all right.&nbsp; It 
		wouldn’t be all right if we weren’t paying for it -- and by the way, 
		that's what a previous Congress did with the prescription drug plan.&nbsp; 
		All they did was they gave the benefits and they didn’t pay for it.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That's not what we’re 
		doing.&nbsp; What we’re doing is we’re taking money that America is already 
		spending in the health care system, but is being spent poorly, that's 
		going to waste and fraud and unwarranted subsidies for the insurance 
		companies, and we’re taking that money and making sure those dollars go 
		towards making insurance more affordable. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So we’re going to eliminate 
		wasteful taxpayer subsidies to insurance companies.&nbsp;We’re going to set a 
		new fee on insurance companies that stand to gain millions of new 
		customers.&nbsp; So here’s the point:&nbsp; This proposal is paid 
		for.&nbsp; Unlike some of these previous schemes in Washington, we’re not 
		taking out the credit card in your name, young people, and charging it 
		to you.&nbsp; We’re making sure this thing is paid for. All right, so that's 
		the second thing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, the third thing that 
		this legislation does is it brings down the cost of health care for 
		families and businesses and the federal government.&nbsp;Americans who are 
		buying comparable coverage in the individual market would end up seeing 
		their premiums go down 14 to 20 percent.&nbsp; Americans who get 
		their insurance through the workplace, cost savings could be as much as 
		$3,000 less per employer than if we do nothing.&nbsp; Now, think about that.&nbsp; 
		That’s $3,000 your employer doesn’t have to pay, which means maybe she 
		can afford to give you a raise.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And by the way, if you’re 
		curious, well, how exactly are we saving these costs?&nbsp; Well, part of it 
		is, again, we’re not spending our health care money wisely.&nbsp; So, for 
		example, you go to the hospital or you go to a doctor and you may take 
		five tests, when it turns out if you just took one test, then you send 
		an e-mail around with the test results, you wouldn’t be paying $500 per 
		test.&nbsp; So we’re trying to save money across the system.&nbsp;And altogether, 
		our cost-cutting measures would reduce most people’s premiums.&nbsp; And 
		here’s the bonus:&nbsp; It brings down our deficit by more than $1 trillion 
		over the next two decades.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So you’ve got -- you’ve got 
		a whole bunch of opponents of this bill saying, well, we can’t afford 
		this; we’re fiscal conservatives.&nbsp; These are the same guys who passed 
		that prescription drug bill without paying for it, adding over $1 
		trillion to our deficit -- “Oh, we can’t afford this.”&nbsp; But this bill, 
		according to the Congressional Budget Office -- which is the referee, 
		the scorekeeper for how much things cost -- says we’ll save us $1 
		trillion.&nbsp; Not only can we afford to do this, we can’t afford not to do 
		this.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So here’s the bottom line.&nbsp; 
		That’s our proposal:&nbsp; toughest insurance reforms in history, one of the 
		biggest deficit-reduction plans in history, and the opportunity to give 
		millions of people -- some of them in your own family, some of the 
		people who are in this auditorium today -- an opportunity for the first 
		time in a very long time to get affordable health care.&nbsp; That’s it.&nbsp; 
		That’s what we’re trying to do.&nbsp;That’s what the Congress of the United 
		States is about to vote on this weekend.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, it would be nice if we 
		were just kind of examining the substance, we were walking through the 
		details of the plan, what it means for you.&nbsp; But that’s not what the 
		cable stations like to talk about.&nbsp;What they like to talk about is the 
		politics of the vote.&nbsp; What does this mean in November?&nbsp; What does it 
		mean to the poll numbers?&nbsp; Is this more of an advantage for Democrats or 
		Republicans?&nbsp; What’s it going to mean for Obama?&nbsp; Will his presidency be 
		crippled, or will he be the comeback kid? That’s what they like to talk 
		about.&nbsp; That’s what they like to talk about.&nbsp; I understand.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">One of the things you 
		realize is basically that a lot of reporting in Washington, it’s just 
		like SportsCenter.&nbsp; It’s considered a sport, and who’s up and who’s 
		down, and everybody’s keeping score.&nbsp; And you got the teams going at 
		it.&nbsp; It’s Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Look, let me say this, 
		George Mason:&nbsp; I don’t know how this plays politically.&nbsp; Nobody really 
		does.&nbsp; I mean, there’s been so much misinformation and so much confusion 
		and the climate at times during the course of this year has been so 
		toxic and people are so anxious because the economy has been going 
		through such a tough time.&nbsp; I don’t know what’s going to happen with the 
		politics on this thing.&nbsp; I don’t know whether my poll numbers go down, 
		they go up.&nbsp; I don’t know what happens in terms of Democrats versus 
		Republicans.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But here’s what I do know.&nbsp; 
		I do know that this bill, this legislation, is going to be enormously 
		important for America’s future.&nbsp;I do know the impact it will have on the 
		millions of Americans who need our help, and the millions more who may 
		not need help right now but a year from now or five years from now or 10 
		years from now, if they have some bad luck; if, heaven forbid, they get 
		sick; if they’ve got a preexisting condition; if their child has a 
		preexisting condition; if they lose their job; if they want to start a 
		company -- I know the impact it will have on them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I know what this reform will 
		mean for people like Leslie Banks, a single mom I met in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; 
		She’s trying to put her daughter through college, just like probably 
		some of your moms and dads are trying to put you through college.&nbsp; And 
		her insurance company just sent her a letter saying they plan to double 
		her premium this year -– have it go up 100 percent.&nbsp; And she can’t 
		afford it.&nbsp; So now she’s trying to figure out, am I going to keep my 
		insurance or am I going to keep my daughter in college?&nbsp; Leslie Banks 
		needs us to pass this reform bill.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I know what reform will mean 
		for people like Laura Klitzka.&nbsp; I met Laura up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, 
		while I was campaigning.&nbsp; She thought she had beaten her breast cancer.&nbsp; 
		Then she discovered it had spread to her bones.&nbsp; And she and her 
		insurance -- she and her husband, they were lucky enough to have 
		insurance, but their medical bills still landed them in debt.&nbsp; So now 
		she’s spending time worrying about the debt when all she wants to do is 
		think about how she can spend time with her two kids.&nbsp; Laura needs us to 
		pass this reform bill.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I know what reform will mean 
		for people like Natoma Canfield.&nbsp; When her insurance company raised her 
		rates, she had to give up her coverage, even though she had been paying 
		thousands of dollars in premiums for years, because she had beaten 
		cancer 11 years earlier.&nbsp; They kept on jacking up her rates, jacking up 
		her rates.&nbsp; Finally she thought she was going to lose her home.&nbsp; She was 
		scared that a sudden illness would lead to financial ruin, but she had 
		no choice.&nbsp; Right now she’s lying in a hospital bed, faced with paying 
		for such an illness, after she had to give up her health insurance.&nbsp; 
		She’s praying that somehow she can afford to get well.&nbsp; She knows that 
		it is time for reform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So George Mason, when you 
		hear people saying, well, why don't we do this more incrementally, why 
		don't we do this a little more piecemeal, why don't we just help the 
		folks that are easiest to help -- my answer is the time for reform is 
		now.&nbsp; We have waited long enough.&nbsp; We have waited long enough.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And in just a few days, a 
		century-long struggle will culminate in a historic vote.&nbsp;We’ve had 
		historic votes before.&nbsp; We had a historic vote to put Social Security in 
		place to make sure that our elderly did not live out their golden years 
		in poverty.&nbsp; We had a historic vote in civil rights to make sure that 
		everybody was equal under the law.&nbsp;As messy as this 
		process is, as frustrating as this process is, as ugly as this process 
		can be, when we have faced such decisions in our past, this nation, time 
		and time again, has chosen to extend its promise to more of its people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You know, the naysayers said 
		that Social Security would lead to socialism.&nbsp;But the men and women of 
		Congress stood fast and created that program that lifted millions out of 
		poverty.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There were cynics that 
		warned that Medicare would lead to a government takeover of our entire 
		health care system, and that it didn’t have much support in the polls.&nbsp; 
		But Democrats and Republicans refused to back down, and they made sure 
		that our seniors had the health care that they needed and could have 
		some basic peace of mind.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So previous generations, 
		those who came before us, made the decision that our seniors and our 
		poor, through Medicaid, should not be forced to go without health care 
		just because they couldn’t afford it.&nbsp; Today it falls to this generation 
		to decide whether we will make that same promise to hardworking 
		middle-class families and small businesses all across America, and to 
		young Americans like yourselves who are just starting out.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So here’s my bottom line.&nbsp; I 
		know this has been a difficult journey.&nbsp; I know this will be a tough 
		vote.&nbsp; I know that everybody is counting votes right now in Washington.&nbsp; 
		But I also remember a quote I saw on a plaque in the White House the 
		other day.&nbsp; It’s hanging in the same room where I demanded answers from 
		insurance executives and just received a bunch of excuses.&nbsp; And it was a 
		quote from Teddy Roosevelt, the person who first called for health care 
		reform -- that Republican -- all those years ago.&nbsp; And it said, 
		“Aggressively fighting for the right is the noblest sport the world 
		affords.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, I don’t know how 
		passing health care will play politically -- but I know it’s right.&nbsp; 
		Teddy Roosevelt knew it was right.&nbsp; Harry Truman knew that it was 
		right.&nbsp; Ted Kennedy knew it was right.&nbsp; And if you believe that it’s 
		right, then you've got to help us finish this fight.&nbsp; You've got to 
		stand with me just like you did three years ago and make some phone 
		calls and knock on some doors, talk to your parents, talk to your 
		friends.&nbsp; Do not quit, do not give up, we keep on going.&nbsp; We are going to get this done.&nbsp; We are going to make history.&nbsp; We are 
		going to fix health care in America with your help.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">God bless you, and God bless 
		the United States of America.</font></p>
