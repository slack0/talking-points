<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much, Ed.&nbsp; And 
		to all the other board members; to honored guests; and to the lovely 
		First Lady.&nbsp;Good evening.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ed is right, I work a lot.&nbsp; 
		And so I wasn’t sure that I should actually come tonight.&nbsp; Biden talked 
		me into it.&nbsp; He leaned over and he said, &quot;Mr. President -- this is no 
		ordinary dinner. This is a big [beep] meal.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's been quite a year since 
		I've spoken here last -- lots of ups, lots of downs -- except for my 
		approval ratings, which have just gone down.&nbsp;But that's politics.&nbsp; It 
		doesn’t bother me.&nbsp; Beside I happen to know that my approval ratings are 
		still very high in the country of my birth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then just the other day, 
		my dear friend, Hillary Clinton, pulled me aside and she gave me a pep 
		talk.&nbsp; She said, despite the numbers, she said, &quot;Don't worry, Barack, 
		you're likeable enough.&quot;&nbsp; Which made me feel better.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course I may not have had 
		the star power that I once had -- but in my defense, neither do all of 
		you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">People say to me, &quot;Mr. 
		President, you helped revive the banking industry, you saved GM and 
		Chrysler.&nbsp; What about the news business?&quot;&nbsp; I have to explain, hey, I'm 
		just the President.&nbsp; I'm not a miracle worker, here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though I am glad that the 
		only person whose ratings fell more than mine last year is here tonight 
		-- great to see you, Jay.&nbsp;I'm also glad that I'm speaking first, because 
		we've all seen what happens when somebody takes the time slot after 
		Leno's.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">JAY LENO:&nbsp; Goodnight, 
		everybody.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; By the way, 
		all of the jokes here tonight are brought to you by our friends at 
		Goldman Sachs.&nbsp; So you don't have to worry -- they make money whether 
		you laugh or not.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We do have a number of 
		notable guests in attendance here tonight.&nbsp; Obviously I'm most pleased 
		that Michelle accompanied me.&nbsp; She doesn’t always go to these things.&nbsp; 
		And there are few things in life that are harder to find and more 
		important to keep than love -- well, love and a birth certificate.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Jonas Brothers are 
		here.&nbsp;They're out there somewhere.&nbsp; Sasha and Malia are huge fans.&nbsp; But, 
		boys, don't get any ideas.&nbsp;I have two words for you -- predator 
		drones.&nbsp;You will never see it coming.&nbsp; You think I'm joking.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Speaking of 'tween 
		heartthrobs, Scott Brown is here.&nbsp; I admire Scott -- a rare politician 
		in Washington with nothing to hide.&nbsp;Now, you should be aware that Scott 
		Brown is not the only one with a salacious photo spread floating 
		around.&nbsp; Recently David Axelrod was offered a centerfold opportunity of 
		his own -- now, I did not know that Krispy-Kreme had a catalog.&nbsp;But it's 
		true.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I saw Michael Steele 
		backstage when we were taking pictures -- aka Notorious GOP.&nbsp; Michael, 
		who knows what truly plagues America today -- taxation without 
		representin' --&nbsp;my brother.&nbsp; I did a similar routine last year, but it 
		always works.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Odds are that the Salahis 
		are here.&nbsp; There haven't been people that were more unwelcome at a party 
		since Charlie Crist.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, John McCain 
		couldn't make it.&nbsp; Recently he claimed that he had never identified 
		himself as a maverick.&nbsp; And we all know what happens in Arizona when you 
		don't have ID.&nbsp; Adios, amigos.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Look, I feel for John.&nbsp; You 
		know, we were on the road together and obviously had a hard-fought 
		battle, and you learn, certainly at the national level, politics isn’t 
		easy.&nbsp; This year I've experienced my share of disappointments.&nbsp; For 
		example, I had my heart set on the Nobel Prize -- for Physics.&nbsp; But, 
		hey, you can't win 'em all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Speaking of undeserved 
		honors, a few weeks ago I was able to throw out the first pitch at the
		<i><a href="http://washington.nationals.mlb.com"><font color="#0000FF">
		Nationals</font></a></i> game.&nbsp; And I don't know if you saw it, but I 
		threw it a little high and a little outside.&nbsp; This is how FOX News 
		covered it:&nbsp; &quot;President panders to extreme left-wing of batter box.&quot;&nbsp; On 
		the other hand, MSNBC had a different take: &quot;President pitches 
		no-hitter.&quot;&nbsp;And then CNN went a different way altogether. [Video shown 
		about volcano eruption in Iceland.] I guess that's why they're the most 
		trusted name in news.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, look, I have a 
		reputation for giving cable a hard time, so let's pick on Politico for a 
		while.&nbsp; You know, people attack Politico for putting a new focus on 
		trivial issues, political fodder, gossip sheet.&nbsp; That's not fair.&nbsp; 
		Politico has been doing this for centuries now.&nbsp; Just check out these 
		headlines -- our researchers found these:&nbsp; &quot;Japan surrenders -- where's 
		the bounce?&quot;&nbsp; Then there's this one:&nbsp; &quot;Lincoln saves Union, but can he 
		save House majority?&quot;&nbsp; I don't know if you can see, there's a little 
		portion there -- &quot;He's lost the Southern white vote.&quot;&nbsp; It's an astute 
		analysis there.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And my favorite, July 3, 
		1776 -- &quot;Senior Whig official: Talks break down, independence dead.&quot;
		</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is nothing new.&nbsp; But 
		even though the mainstream press gives me a hard time, I hear that I'm 
		still pretty big on Twitter, Facebook -- or as Sarah Palin calls it, 
		&quot;the socialized media.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, that's not the 
		only thing that we've been accused of socializing this year.&nbsp; You might 
		have heard we passed a health care bill and -- Is that Roger Ailes 
		applauding out there?&nbsp; Some Republicans have suggested that the bill 
		contains a few secret provisions.&nbsp; That's ridiculous.&nbsp; There aren’t a 
		few secret provisions in the health care plan -- there are, like, 
		hundreds.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tonight, in the interest of 
		transparency, I'd like to share a couple.&nbsp; Let's see -- this provision 
		is called the Bay State of Denial.&nbsp; It reads:&nbsp; &quot;This bill shall cover 
		short-term memory loss related to the passage of Massachusetts health 
		care reform.&quot;&nbsp; So, good news, Mitt, your condition is covered.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This next provision is 
		called the Jersey Shore-Up.&nbsp; It reads:&nbsp; &quot;The following individuals shall 
		be excluded from the indoor tanning tax within this bill.&quot;&nbsp; Snooki, J-WOWW, 
		the Situation, and House Minority Leader John Boehner.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This provision ought to put 
		a common misperception to rest. It says right here:&nbsp; &quot;If you do not like 
		the ruling of your death panel you can appeal.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, look, obviously I've 
		learned this year politics can be a tough business, but there are times 
		where you just can't help but laugh.&nbsp; You know what really tickles me?&nbsp; 
		Eric Massa.&nbsp; Apparently Massa claimed that Rahm came up to him one day 
		in the House locker room, stark naked, started screaming obscenities at 
		him -- to which I say, welcome to my world.&nbsp; I feel you.&nbsp; It's a tense 
		moment.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, even as we enjoy 
		each other's company tonight, we're also mindful of the incredible 
		struggles of our fellow Americans in the Gulf Coast, both those leading 
		the efforts to stem this crisis and those along the coast whose 
		livelihoods are in jeopardy as a result of the spill.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also in our thoughts and 
		prayers tonight are the men and women in uniform who put their lives at 
		risk each and every day for our safety and freedom.&nbsp; So in that spirit, 
		I'd also like to pay a tribute to the journalists who play an 
		extraordinary role in telling their stories.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Earlier today I gave the 
		commencement address at Michigan, where I spoke to the graduates about 
		what is required to keep out democracy thriving in the 21st century.&nbsp; 
		And one of the points I made is that for all the changes and challenges 
		facing your industry, this country absolutely needs a healthy, vibrant 
		media. 'Probably needs it more than ever now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today's technology -- 
		today's technology has made it possible for us to get our news and 
		information from a growing range of sources.&nbsp; We can pick and choose not 
		only our preferred type of media, but also our preferred perspective.&nbsp; 
		And while that exposes us to an unprecedented array of opinions, 
		analysis, and points of view, it also makes it that much more important 
		that we're all operating on a common baseline of facts. It makes it that 
		much more important that journalists out there seek only the truth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I don't have to tell you 
		that.&nbsp; Some of you are seasoned veterans who have been on the political 
		beat for decades; others here tonight began their careers as bloggers 
		not long ago.&nbsp; But I think it's fair to say that every single reporter 
		in this room believes deeply in the enterprise of journalism.&nbsp; Every one 
		of you, even the most cynical among you, understands and cherishes the 
		function of a free press and the preservation of our system of 
		government and of our way of life.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I want you to know that 
		for all the jokes and the occasional gripes, I cherish that work, as 
		well.&nbsp; In fact, tonight I wanted to present all of you with a bipartisan 
		congressional resolution that honors all those wonderful contributions 
		that journalists have made to our country and the world -- but, 
		unfortunately, I couldn't break the filibuster.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much, 
		everybody.&nbsp; God bless you and God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
