transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp; Everyone please have a seat.&nbsp; Thank you 
		very much.&nbsp; Let -- Let me thank 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hybels">
		<font color="#0000FF">Pastor Hybels</font></a> from near my hometown in Chicago, 
		who took time off his vacation to be here today.&nbsp; We are blessed to have 
		him.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank President 
		Neil Kerwin and our hosts here at American University; acknowledge my 
		outstanding Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis, and members of my 
		administration; all the members of Congress -- Hilda deserves applause.&nbsp; 
		To all the members of Congress, the elected officials, 
		faith and law enforcement, labor, business leaders and immigration 
		advocates who are here today -- thank you for your presence.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank American 
		University for welcoming me to the campus once again.&nbsp; Some may recall 
		that the last time I was here I was joined by a dear friend, and a giant 
		of American politics, Senator Edward Kennedy.&nbsp; Teddy’s not 
		here right now, but his legacy of civil rights and health care and 
		worker protections is still with us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I was a candidate for 
		President that day, and some may recall I argued that our country had 
		reached a tipping point; that after years in which we had deferred our 
		most pressing problems, and too often yielded to the politics of the 
		moment, we now faced a choice:&nbsp; We could squarely confront our 
		challenges with honesty and determination, or we could consign ourselves 
		and our children to a future less prosperous and less secure.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believed that then and I 
		believe it now.&nbsp; And that’s why, even as we’ve tackled the most severe 
		economic crisis since the Great Depression, even as we’ve wound down the 
		war in Iraq and refocused our efforts in Afghanistan, my administration 
		has refused to ignore some of the fundamental challenges facing this 
		generation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We launched the most 
		aggressive education reforms in decades, so that our children can gain 
		the knowledge and skills they need to compete in a 21st century global 
		economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have finally delivered on 
		the promise of health reform -- reform that will bring greater security 
		to every American, and that will rein in the skyrocketing costs that 
		threaten families, businesses and the prosperity of our nation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re on the verge of 
		reforming an outdated and ineffective set of rules governing Wall Street 
		-- to give greater power to consumers and prevent the reckless financial 
		speculation that led to this severe recession.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we’re accelerating the 
		transition to a clean energy economy by significantly raising the 
		fuel-efficiency standards of cars and trucks, and by doubling our use of 
		renewable energies like wind and solar power -- steps that have the 
		potential to create whole new industries and hundreds of thousands of 
		new jobs in America.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, despite the forces of 
		the status quo, despite the polarization and the frequent pettiness of 
		our politics, we are confronting the great challenges of our times.&nbsp; And 
		while this work isn’t easy, and the changes we seek won’t always happen 
		overnight, what we’ve made clear is that this administration will not 
		just kick the can down the road.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Immigration reform is no 
		exception.&nbsp; In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once 
		more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a 
		controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we’ve seen across 
		America.&nbsp; Some have rallied behind this new policy.&nbsp; Others have 
		protested and launched boycotts of the state.&nbsp; And everywhere, people 
		have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally 
		broken.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, the tensions 
		around immigration are not new.&nbsp; On the one hand, we’ve always defined 
		ourselves as a nation of immigrants -- a nation that welcomes those 
		willing to embrace America’s precepts.&nbsp; Indeed, it is this constant flow 
		of immigrants that helped to make America what it is.&nbsp; The scientific 
		breakthroughs of Albert Einstein, the inventions of Nikola Tesla, the 
		great ventures of Andrew Carnegie’s U.S. Steel and Sergey Brin’s Google, 
		Inc. -- all this was possible because of immigrants.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then there are the 
		countless names and the quiet acts that never made the history books but 
		were no less consequential in building this country -- the generations 
		who braved hardship and great risk to reach our shores in search of a 
		better life for themselves and their families; the millions of people, 
		ancestors to most of us, who believed that there was a place where they 
		could be, at long last, free to work and worship and live their lives in 
		peace.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this steady stream of 
		hardworking and talented people has made America the engine of the 
		global economy and a beacon of hope around the world.&nbsp; And it’s allowed 
		us to adapt and thrive in the face of technological and societal 
		change.&nbsp; To this day, America reaps incredible economic rewards because 
		we remain a magnet for the best and brightest from across the globe.&nbsp; 
		Folks travel here in the hopes of being a part of a culture of 
		entrepreneurship and ingenuity, and by doing so they strengthen and 
		enrich that culture.&nbsp; Immigration also means we have a younger workforce 
		-- and a faster-growing economy -- than many of our competitors.&nbsp; And in 
		an increasingly interconnected world, the diversity of our country is a 
		powerful advantage in global competition.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just a few weeks ago, we had 
		an event of small business owners at the White House.&nbsp; And one business 
		owner was a woman named Prachee Devadas who came to this country, became 
		a citizen, and opened up a successful technology services company.&nbsp; When 
		she started, she had just one employee.&nbsp; Today, she employs more than a 
		hundred people.&nbsp; This past April, we held a naturalization ceremony at 
		the White House for members of our armed forces.&nbsp; Even though they were 
		not yet citizens, they had enlisted.&nbsp; One of them was a woman named 
		Perla Ramos -- born and raised in Mexico, came to the United States 
		shortly after 9/11, and she eventually joined the Navy.&nbsp; And she said, 
		“I take pride in our flag and the history that forged this great nation 
		and the history we write day by day.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These women, and men and 
		women across this country like them, remind us that immigrants have 
		always helped to build and defend this country -- and that being an 
		American is not a matter of blood or birth.&nbsp; It’s a matter of faith.&nbsp; 
		It’s a matter of fidelity to the shared values that we all hold so 
		dear.&nbsp; That’s what makes us unique.&nbsp; That’s what makes us strong.&nbsp; 
		Anybody can help us write the next great chapter in our history.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we can’t forget that 
		this process of immigration and eventual inclusion has often been 
		painful.&nbsp; Each new wave of immigrants has generated fear and resentments 
		towards newcomers, particularly in times of economic upheaval.&nbsp; Our 
		founding was rooted in the notion that America was unique as a place of 
		refuge and freedom for, in Thomas Jefferson’s words, “oppressed 
		humanity.”&nbsp; But the ink on our Constitution was barely dry when, amidst 
		conflict, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which placed 
		harsh restrictions of those suspected of having foreign allegiances.&nbsp; A 
		century ago, immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Poland, other European 
		countries were routinely subjected to rank discrimination and ugly 
		stereotypes.&nbsp; Chinese immigrants were held in detention and deported 
		from Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay.&nbsp; They didn’t even get to 
		come in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the politics of who is 
		and who is not allowed to enter this country, and on what terms, has 
		always been contentious.&nbsp; And that remains true today.&nbsp; And it’s made 
		worse by a failure of those of us in Washington to fix a broken 
		immigration system.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To begin with, our borders 
		have been porous for decades.&nbsp; Obviously, the problem is greatest along 
		our Southern border, but it’s not restricted to that part of the 
		country.&nbsp; In fact, because we don’t do a very good job of tracking who 
		comes in and out of the country as visitors, large numbers avoid 
		immigration laws simply by overstaying their visas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The result is an estimated 
		11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.&nbsp; The 
		overwhelming majority of these men and women are simply seeking a better 
		life for themselves and their children.&nbsp; Many settle in low-wage sectors 
		of the economy; they work hard, they save, they stay out of trouble.&nbsp; 
		But because they live in the shadows, they’re vulnerable to unscrupulous 
		businesses who pay them less than the minimum wage or violate worker 
		safety rules -- thereby putting companies who follow those rules, and 
		Americans who rightly demand the minimum wage or overtime, at an unfair 
		[dis]advantage.&nbsp; Crimes go unreported as victims and witnesses fear 
		coming forward.&nbsp; And this makes it harder for the police to catch 
		violent criminals and keep neighborhoods safe.&nbsp; And billions in tax 
		revenue are lost each year because many undocumented workers are paid 
		under the table.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">More fundamentally, the 
		presence of so many illegal immigrants makes a mockery of all those who 
		are going through the process of immigrating legally.&nbsp; Indeed, after 
		years of patchwork fixes and ill-conceived revisions, the legal 
		immigration system is as broken as the borders.&nbsp; Backlogs and 
		bureaucracy means the process can take years.&nbsp; While an applicant waits 
		for approval, he or she is often forbidden from visiting the United 
		States -- which means even husbands and wives may be forced to spend 
		many years apart.&nbsp; High fees and the need for lawyers may exclude worthy 
		applicants.&nbsp; And while we provide students from around the world visas 
		to get engineering and computer science degrees at our top universities, 
		our laws discourage them from using those skills to start a business or 
		power a new industry right here in the United States.&nbsp; Instead of 
		training entrepreneurs to create jobs on our shores, we train our 
		competition.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In sum, the system is 
		broken.&nbsp; And everybody knows it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, reform has been held 
		hostage to political posturing and special-interest wrangling -- and to 
		the pervasive sentiment in Washington that tackling such a thorny and 
		emotional issue is inherently bad politics.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just a few years ago, when I 
		was a senator, we forged a bipartisan coalition in favor of 
		comprehensive reform.&nbsp; Under the leadership of Senator Kennedy, who had 
		been a longtime champion of immigration reform, and Senator John McCain, 
		we worked across the aisle to help pass a bipartisan bill through the 
		Senate.&nbsp; But that effort eventually came apart.&nbsp; And now, under the 
		pressures of partisanship and election-year politics, many of the 11 
		Republican senators who voted for reform in the past have now backed 
		away from their previous support.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Into this breach, states 
		like Arizona have decided to take matters into their own hands.&nbsp; Given 
		the levels of frustration across the country, this is understandable.&nbsp; 
		But it is also ill conceived.&nbsp; And it’s not just that the law Arizona 
		passed is divisive -- although it has fanned the flames of an already 
		contentious debate.&nbsp; Laws like Arizona’s put huge pressures on local law 
		enforcement to enforce rules that ultimately are unenforceable.&nbsp; It puts 
		pressure on already hard-strapped state and local budgets.&nbsp; It makes it 
		difficult for people here illegally to report crimes -- driving a wedge 
		between communities and law enforcement, making our streets more 
		dangerous and the jobs of our police officers more difficult.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And you don’t have to take 
		my word for this.&nbsp; You can speak to the police chiefs and others from 
		law enforcement here today who will tell you the same thing.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These laws also have the 
		potential of violating the rights of innocent American citizens and 
		legal residents, making them subject to possible stops or questioning 
		because of what they look like or how they sound.&nbsp; And as other states 
		and localities go their own ways, we face the prospect that different 
		rules for immigration will apply in different parts of the country -- a 
		patchwork of local immigration rules where we all know one clear 
		national standard is needed.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our task then is to make our 
		national laws actually work -- to shape a system that reflects our 
		values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.&nbsp; And that means 
		being honest about the problem, and getting past the false debates that 
		divide the country rather than bring it together.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For example, there are those 
		in the immigrants’ rights community who have argued passionately that we 
		should simply provide those who are [here] illegally with legal status, 
		or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation 
		until we have better laws.&nbsp; And often this argument is framed in moral 
		terms:&nbsp; Why should we punish people who are just trying to earn a 
		living?&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I recognize the sense of 
		compassion that drives this argument, but I believe such an 
		indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair.&nbsp; It would 
		suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be 
		no repercussions for such a decision.&nbsp; And this could lead to a surge in 
		more illegal immigration.&nbsp; And it would also ignore the millions of 
		people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ultimately, our nation, like 
		all nations, has the right and obligation to control its borders and set 
		laws for residency and citizenship.&nbsp; And no matter how decent they are, 
		no matter their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be 
		held accountable.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, if the majority of 
		Americans are skeptical of a blanket amnesty, they are also skeptical 
		that it is possible to round up and deport 11 million people.&nbsp; They know 
		it’s not possible.&nbsp; Such an effort would be logistically impossible and 
		wildly expensive.&nbsp; Moreover, it would tear at the very fabric of this 
		nation -- because immigrants who are here illegally are now intricately 
		woven into that fabric.&nbsp; Many have children who are American citizens.&nbsp; 
		Some are children themselves, brought here by their parents at a very 
		young age, growing up as American kids, only to discover their illegal 
		status when they apply for college or a job.&nbsp; Migrant workers -- mostly 
		here illegally -- have been the labor force of our farmers and 
		agricultural producers for generations.&nbsp; So even if it was possible, a 
		program of mass deportations would disrupt our economy and communities 
		in ways that most Americans would find intolerable.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, once we get past the 
		two poles of this debate, it becomes possible to shape a practical, 
		common-sense approach that reflects our heritage and our values.&nbsp; Such 
		an approach demands accountability from everybody -- from government, 
		from businesses and from individuals.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Government has a threshold 
		responsibility to secure our borders.&nbsp; That’s why I directed my 
		Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano -- a former border 
		governor -- to improve our enforcement policy without having to wait for 
		a new law.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, we have more boots on 
		the ground near the Southwest border than at any time in our history.&nbsp; 
		Let me repeat that:&nbsp; We have more boots on the ground on the Southwest 
		border than at any time in our history.&nbsp; We doubled the personnel 
		assigned to Border Enforcement Security Task Forces.&nbsp; We tripled the 
		number of intelligence analysts along the border.&nbsp; For the first time, 
		we’ve begun screening 100 percent of southbound rail shipments.&nbsp; And as 
		a result, we’re seizing more illegal guns, cash and drugs than in years 
		past.&nbsp; Contrary to some of the reports that you see, crime along the 
		border is down.&nbsp; And statistics collected by Customs and Border 
		Protection reflect a significant reduction in the number of people 
		trying to cross the border illegally.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the bottom line is this:&nbsp; 
		The southern border is more secure today than at any time in the past 20 
		years.&nbsp; That doesn’t mean we don’t have more work to do.&nbsp; We have to do 
		that work, but it’s important that we acknowledge the facts.&nbsp; Even as we 
		are committed to doing what’s necessary to secure our borders, even 
		without passage of the new law, there are those who argue that we should 
		not move forward with any other elements of reform until we have fully 
		sealed our borders.&nbsp; But our borders are just too vast for us to be able 
		to solve the problem only with fences and border patrols.&nbsp; It won’t 
		work.&nbsp; Our borders will not be secure as long as our limited resources 
		are devoted to not only stopping gangs and potential terrorists, but 
		also the hundreds of thousands who attempt to cross each year simply to 
		find work.&nbsp; <br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		That’s why businesses must be held accountable if they break the law by 
		deliberately hiring and exploiting undocumented workers.&nbsp; We’ve already 
		begun to step up enforcement against the worst workplace offenders.&nbsp; And 
		we’re implementing and improving a system to give employers a reliable 
		way to verify that their employees are here legally.&nbsp; But we need to do 
		more.&nbsp; We cannot continue just to look the other way as a significant 
		portion of our economy operates outside the law.&nbsp; It breeds abuse and 
		bad practices.&nbsp; It punishes employers who act responsibly and undercuts 
		American workers.&nbsp; And ultimately, if the demand for undocumented 
		workers falls, the incentive for people to come here illegally will 
		decline as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, we have to demand 
		responsibility from people living here illegally.&nbsp; They must be required 
		to admit that they broke the law.&nbsp; They should be required to register, 
		pay their taxes, pay a fine, and learn English.&nbsp; They must get right 
		with the law before they can get in line and earn their citizenship -- 
		not just because it is fair, not just because it will make clear to 
		those who might wish to come to America they must do so inside the 
		bounds of the law, but because this is how we demonstrate that being -- 
		what being an American means.&nbsp; Being a citizen of this country comes not 
		only with rights but also with certain fundamental responsibilities.&nbsp; We 
		can create a pathway for legal status that is fair, reflective of our 
		values, and works.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, stopping illegal 
		immigration must go hand in hand with reforming our creaky system of 
		legal immigration.&nbsp; We’ve begun to do that, by eliminating a backlog in 
		background checks that at one point stretched back almost a year.&nbsp; 
		That’s just for the background check.&nbsp; People can now track the status 
		of their immigration applications by email or text message.&nbsp; We’ve 
		improved accountability and safety in the detention system.&nbsp; And we’ve 
		stemmed the increases in naturalization fees.&nbsp; But here, too, we need to 
		do more.&nbsp; We should make it easier for the best and the brightest to 
		come to start businesses and develop products and create jobs.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our laws should respect 
		families following the rules -- instead of splitting them apart.&nbsp; We 
		need to provide farms a legal way to hire the workers they rely on, and 
		a path for those workers to earn legal status.&nbsp; And we should stop 
		punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents by 
		denying them the chance to stay here and earn an education and 
		contribute their talents to build the country where they’ve grown up.&nbsp; 
		The DREAM Act would do this, and that’s why I supported this bill as a 
		state legislator and as a U.S. senator -- and why I continue to support 
		it as president.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
		So these are the essential elements of comprehensive immigration 
		reform.&nbsp; The question now is whether we will have the courage and the 
		political will to pass a bill through Congress, to finally get it done.&nbsp; 
		Last summer, I held a meeting with leaders of both parties, including 
		many of the Republicans who had supported reform in the past -- and some 
		who hadn’t.&nbsp; I was pleased to see a bipartisan framework proposed in the 
		Senate by Senators Lindsey Graham and Chuck Schumer, with whom I met to 
		discuss this issue.&nbsp; I’ve spoken with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus 
		to plot the way forward and meet -- and then I met with them earlier 
		this week.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I’ve spoken with 
		representatives from a growing coalition of labor unions and business 
		groups, immigrant advocates and community organizations, law 
		enforcement, local government -- all who recognize the importance of 
		immigration reform.&nbsp; And I’ve met with leaders from America’s religious 
		communities, like Pastor Hybels -- people of different faiths and 
		beliefs, some liberal, some conservative, who nonetheless share a sense 
		of urgency; who understand that fixing our broken immigration system is 
		not only a political issue, not just an economic issue, but a moral 
		imperative as well.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we’ve made progress.&nbsp; I’m 
		ready to move forward; the majority of Democrats are ready to move 
		forward; and I believe the majority of Americans are ready to move 
		forward.&nbsp; But the fact is, without bipartisan support, as we had just a 
		few years ago, we cannot solve this problem.&nbsp; Reform that brings 
		accountability to our immigration system cannot pass without Republican 
		votes.&nbsp; That is the political and mathematical reality.&nbsp; The only way to 
		reduce the risk that this effort will again falter because of politics 
		is if members of both parties are willing to take responsibility for 
		solving this problem once and for all.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, yes, this is an 
		emotional question, and one that lends itself to demagoguery.&nbsp; Time and 
		again, this issue has been used to divide and inflame -- and to demonize 
		people.&nbsp; And so the understandable, the natural impulse among those who 
		run for office is to turn away and defer this question for another day, 
		or another year, or another administration.&nbsp; Despite the courageous 
		leadership in the past shown by many Democrats and some Republicans -- 
		including, by the way, my predecessor, President Bush -- this has been 
		the custom.&nbsp; That is why a broken and dangerous system that offends our 
		most basic American values is still in place.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I believe we can put 
		politics aside and finally have an immigration system that’s 
		accountable.&nbsp; I believe we can appeal not to people’s fears but to their 
		hopes, to their highest ideals, because that’s who we are as Americans.&nbsp; 
		It’s been inscribed on our nation’s seal since we declared our 
		independence.&nbsp; “E pluribus unum.”&nbsp; Out of many, one.&nbsp; That is what has 
		drawn the persecuted and impoverished to our shores.&nbsp; That’s what led 
		the innovators and risk-takers from around the world to take a chance 
		here in the land of opportunity.&nbsp; That’s what has led people to endure 
		untold hardships to reach this place called America.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;One of the largest 
		waves of immigration in our history took place little more than a 
		century ago.&nbsp; At the time, Jewish people were being driven out of 
		Eastern Europe, often escaping to the sounds of gunfire and the light 
		from their villages burning to the ground.&nbsp; The journey could take 
		months, as families crossed rivers in the dead of night, traveled miles 
		by foot, endured a rough and dangerous passage over the North Atlantic.&nbsp; 
		Once here, many made their homes in a teeming and bustling Lower 
		Manhattan.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was at this time that a 
		young woman named Emma Lazarus, whose own family fled persecution from 
		Europe generations earlier, took up the cause of these new immigrants.&nbsp; 
		Although she was a poet, she spent much of her time advocating for 
		better health care and housing for the newcomers.&nbsp; And inspired by what 
		she saw and heard, she wrote down her thoughts and donated a piece of 
		work to help pay for the construction of a new statue -- the Statue of 
		Liberty -- which actually was funded in part by small donations from 
		people across America.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Years before the statue was 
		built -- years before it would be seen by throngs of immigrants craning 
		their necks skyward at the end of long and brutal voyage, years before 
		it would come to symbolize everything that we cherish -- she imagined 
		what it could mean.&nbsp; She imagined the sight of a giant statue at the 
		entry point of a great nation -- but unlike the great monuments of the 
		past, this would not signal an empire.&nbsp; Instead, it would signal one’s 
		arrival to a place of opportunity and refuge and freedom.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">“Here at our sea-washed, 
		sunset gates shall stand,” she wrote,</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">A mighty woman with a torch…<br>From her beacon-hand<br>Glows world-wide welcome…<br>“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!”…<br>“Give me your tired, and your poor,<br>Your huddled masses yearning to be free…<br>Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,<br>I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us remember these 
		words.&nbsp; For it falls on each generation to ensure that that lamp -- that 
		beacon -- continues to shine as a source of hope around the world, and a 
		source of our prosperity here at home.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp; 
		And may God bless the United States of America.&nbsp; Thank you.</font></p>
