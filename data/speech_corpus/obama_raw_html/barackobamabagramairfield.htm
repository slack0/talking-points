transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello, everybody!&nbsp; I’m 
		sorry, Bagram, I can’t hear you.&nbsp;Air Assault!&nbsp; It -- It is great to be back.&nbsp; 
		Let me first of all thank the 101st Airborne Division Band.&nbsp; Where’s the 
		band?&nbsp; Give them a big round of applause.&nbsp; Thank you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To Chief Thomas Hager and to 
		the commander and conductor.&nbsp; I gather we had a couple of other bands 
		playing, Manifest Destiny and Nuts.&nbsp; I don’t know about, you know -- I 
		don’t know how they sounded.&nbsp; What did you think?&nbsp; Were they pretty 
		good?&nbsp; Hooah!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is great to be back.&nbsp; And 
		I apologize for keeping you guys up late, coming on such short notice.&nbsp; 
		But I wanted to make sure that I could spend a little time this holiday 
		with the men and women of the finest fighting force that the world has 
		ever known, and that’s all of you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank General 
		Petraeus, not only for the introduction and the T-shirts, but for 
		General Petraeus’s lifetime of service.&nbsp; This is somebody who has helped 
		change the way we fight wars and win wars in the 21st century.&nbsp; And I am 
		very grateful that he agreed to take command of our efforts here in 
		Afghanistan.&nbsp; He has been an extraordinary warrior on behalf of the 
		American people.&nbsp; Thank you, David Petraeus.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank all your 
		outstanding leaders who welcomed me here, including General John 
		Campbell; Admiral Bill McRaven from the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing; 
		Colonel Todd Canterbury.&nbsp; I want to salute your great senior enlisted 
		leaders, including Command Sergeant Major Scott Schroeder -- hooah! -- 
		Command Sergeant Major Chris Farris, and Command Chief Craig Adams.&nbsp; 
		Hooah!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also want to acknowledge 
		the outstanding work that our civilians are doing each and every day, 
		starting with Karl Eikenberry all the way through to your senior 
		civilian representative Thomas Gibbons and all the civilians who are 
		here.&nbsp; They are fighting alongside you.&nbsp; They are putting themselves at 
		risk.&nbsp; They are away from their families.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we are very, very 
		grateful to them as well.&nbsp; So give them a big round of applause.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think we’ve got every 
		service here tonight.&nbsp; We’ve got Army.&nbsp;We’ve got Navy.&nbsp; We’ve got Air 
		Force.&nbsp;I think we may have a few Marines around, too.&nbsp;And a whole lot of 
		folks from the 101st Airborne Division, The Screaming Eagles.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here in Afghanistan, you are 
		all -- Coast Guard, is that what I heard? Here in Afghanistan, all of 
		you are part of one team, serving together, succeeding together, except 
		maybe in next week’s Army-Navy game.&nbsp; As your Commander-in-Chief, I’ve 
		got to stay neutral on that.&nbsp;We also have some ISAF partners here as 
		well. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, when I was here in 
		the spring, we had a coalition of 43 nations.&nbsp; Now we’ve got a coalition 
		of 49 nations.&nbsp; And this sends a powerful message that the coalition of 
		nations that supports Afghanistan is strong and is growing. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I’m not here to give a 
		long speech.&nbsp; I want to shake as many hands as I can.&nbsp; Hooah!&nbsp; But let 
		me say that at this time of year, Americans are giving thanks for all 
		the blessings that we have.&nbsp; And as we begin this holiday season, there 
		is no place that I’d rather be than be here with you. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know it’s not easy for all 
		of you to be away from home, especially during the holidays.&nbsp; And I know 
		it’s hard on your families.&nbsp; They’ve got an empty seat at the dinner 
		table.&nbsp; Sometimes during the holiday season that’s when you feel the 
		absence of somebody you love most acutely. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But here’s what I want you 
		to know.&nbsp; As President of the United States, I have no greater 
		responsibility than keeping the American people secure.&nbsp; I could not 
		meet that responsibility, we could not protect the American people, we 
		could not enjoy the blessings of our liberty without the extraordinary 
		service that each and every one of you perform each and every day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So on behalf of me, on 
		behalf of Michelle, on behalf of Malia and Sasha, on behalf of more than 
		300 million Americans, we are here to say thank you.&nbsp;Hooah!&nbsp; We are here 
		to say thank you for everything that you do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I also want to say 
		thank you to your families back home so that when you talk to them you 
		know that they know.&nbsp;They’re serving here with you -- in mind and 
		spirit, if not in body. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Millions of Americans give 
		thanks this holiday season just as generations have before when they 
		think about our armed services.&nbsp; You’re part of an unbroken line of 
		Americans who have given up your comfort, your ease, your convenience 
		for America’s security. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was on another cold 
		December more than 200 years ago that a band of patriots helped to found 
		our nation, defeat an empire -- from that icy river to the fields of 
		Europe, from the islands in the Pacific to the hills of Korea, from the 
		jungles of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, those who went before you, 
		they also found themselves in this season of peace serving in war.&nbsp; They 
		did it for the same reason that all of you do -- because the freedom and 
		the liberty that we treasure, that’s not simply a birthright.&nbsp; It has to 
		be earned by the sacrifices of generations -- generations of patriots, 
		men and women who step forward and say, send me.&nbsp; I know somebody has 
		got to do it, and I’m willing to serve.&nbsp; Men and women who are willing 
		to risk all and some who gave all to keep us safe, to keep us free.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In our time, in this 21st 
		century, when so many other institutions seem to be shirking their 
		responsibilities, you’ve embraced your responsibilities.&nbsp; You’ve shown 
		why the United States military remains the most trusted institution in 
		America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s the legacy that your 
		generation has forged during this decade of trial in Iraq and here in 
		Afghanistan.&nbsp; That’s the legacy that you’re carrying forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As General Petraeus 
		mentioned, one year ago I ordered additional troops to serve in this 
		country that was the staging ground for the 9/11 attacks.&nbsp; All of those 
		troops are now in place.&nbsp; And thanks to your service, we are making 
		important progress.&nbsp; You are protecting your country.&nbsp; You’re achieving 
		your objectives.&nbsp; You will succeed in your mission.&nbsp;Hooah!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We said we were going to 
		break the Taliban’s momentum, and that’s what you’re doing.&nbsp; You’re 
		going on the offense, tired of playing defense, targeting their leaders, 
		pushing them out of their strongholds.&nbsp; Today we can be proud that there 
		are fewer areas under Taliban control and more Afghans have a chance to 
		build a more hopeful future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We said a year ago that 
		we’re going to build the capacity of the Afghan people.&nbsp; And that’s what 
		you’re doing, meeting our recruitment targets, training Afghan forces, 
		partnering with those Afghans who want to build a stronger and more 
		stable and more prosperous Afghanistan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t need to tell you 
		this is a tough fight.&nbsp; I just came from the medical unit and saw our 
		wounded warriors, pinned some Purple Hearts.&nbsp; I just talked to the 
		platoon that lost six of their buddies in a senseless act of violence. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is tough business.&nbsp; 
		Progress comes slow.&nbsp; There are going to be difficult days ahead.&nbsp; 
		Progress comes at a high price.&nbsp; So many of you have stood before the 
		solemn battle cross, display of boots, a rifle, a helmet, and said 
		good-bye to a fallen comrade.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This year alone nearly 100 
		members of 101st have given their last full measure of devotion.&nbsp; There 
		are few days when I don’t sign a letter to a military family expressing 
		our nation’s gratitude and grief at their profound sacrifice.&nbsp; And this 
		holiday season our thoughts and prayers are with those who’ve lost a 
		loved one -- the father and mother, the son or daughter, the brother or 
		sister or friend who’s not coming home.&nbsp; And we know that their memories 
		will never be forgotten and that their life has added to the life of our 
		nation.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamabagramsoldierssouza.jpg" width="233" height="156">
		And because of the service of the men and 
		women of the United States military, because of the progress you’re 
		making, we look forward to a new phase next year, the beginning of a 
		transition to Afghan responsibility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As we do, we continue to 
		forge a partnership with the Afghan people for the long term.&nbsp; And we 
		will never let this country serve as a safe haven for terrorists who 
		would attack the United States of America again.&nbsp; That will never 
		happen.&nbsp; Hooah! &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This part of the world is 
		the center of a global effort where we are going to disrupt and 
		dismantle and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist allies.&nbsp; And that’s why 
		you’re here.&nbsp; That’s why your mission matters so much.&nbsp; That’s why you 
		must succeed -- because this effort is about the safety of our 
		communities back home and the dignity of the Afghan people who don’t 
		want to live in tyranny.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, even though it is a 
		hallmark of American democracy that we have our arguments back home, we 
		have our debates, we have our elections, I can say without hesitation 
		that there is no division on one thing, no hesitation on one thing -- 
		and that is the uniform support of our men and women who are serving in 
		the armed services.&nbsp; Hooah!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Everybody -- everybody is 
		behind you.&nbsp; Everybody back home is behind you.&nbsp; Everybody, from north 
		to south to east to west, from sea to shining sea, the American people 
		are united in support of you and your families.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as your 
		Commander-in-Chief, I also want you to know that we will do whatever it 
		takes to make sure that you have the strategy and the resources and the 
		equipment and the leadership to get this done. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You may have noticed that 
		during these tough budget times, I took the step of freezing pay for our 
		federal workforce.&nbsp; But because of the service that you rendered, all 
		who wear the uniform of the United States of America are exempt from 
		that action.&nbsp; Hooah!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we’re going to make -- 
		we’re going to spare no effort to make sure that your families have the 
		support that they deserve as well.&nbsp; That doesn’t just matter to me.&nbsp; 
		It’s also a top priority for Michelle -- to make sure that Americans 
		understand the sacrifices that your families are making.&nbsp; As she likes 
		to say, 100 percent of Americans need to be right -- they are supporting 
		you and your families -- 100 percent.&nbsp; Only 1 percent are fighting these 
		wars, but 100 percent of us have to be behind you and your families.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your generation, the 
		generation of Afghanistan and Iraq, has met every mission that you’ve 
		been given.&nbsp; You’ve served tour after tour.&nbsp; You’ve earned not just our 
		admiration; you’ve earned your place in American history alongside those 
		greatest generations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the stories of those who 
		served in these wars are too numerous to tell.&nbsp; But one of my greatest 
		privileges as President is to get to know the stories of those who earn 
		the Medal of Honor. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Two months ago, I presented 
		the Medal to the parents of Staff Sergeant Robert Miller, who gave his 
		life here in Afghanistan as a member of the Green Berets.&nbsp; His valor, 
		charging toward some 150 insurgents, saved the lives of nearly two dozen 
		American and Afghan comrades. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last month, we held another 
		ceremony.&nbsp; For the first time in nearly 40 years, the recipient of the 
		Medal of Honor for an ongoing conflict was actually able to accept it in 
		person.&nbsp; His name is Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta.&nbsp; And some of you 
		may have seen his story, but I want to tell it again tonight because of 
		what it says not just about our armed forces, but also what it says 
		about the country that we love.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So three years ago, Sal and 
		his platoon were in Korengal Valley.&nbsp; When their patrol was ambushed, 
		two Americans lay wounded up ahead.&nbsp; That’s when Sal and his men 
		counter-attacked.&nbsp; Again and again and again, they were being rained 
		down with fire.&nbsp; But they just kept counter-attacking because they 
		wanted to get their two buddies.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And when he saw one of his 
		teammates wounded and being carried away by insurgents, Sal rushed in to 
		help his friends -- despite the bullets.&nbsp; Despite the danger, he kept on 
		pressing forward.&nbsp; It was an incredibly intense firefight.&nbsp; And by the 
		time it was finished, every single member of that platoon had shrapnel 
		or a bullet hole in their gear.&nbsp; Five were wounded, and two had given 
		their lives.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, Sal is a pretty humble 
		guy.&nbsp; And so when he came to the White House he said, “You know, I 
		didn’t do anything special.”&nbsp; He said he was just doing his job, that he 
		didn’t do anything that his brothers wouldn’t have done for him.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">“If I’m a hero,” he said, 
		“then every man who stands around me, every woman in the military, every 
		person who defends this country is also a hero.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And he’s right.&nbsp; Each of you 
		has your own story.&nbsp; Each of you is writing your own chapter in the 
		story of America and the story of American armed forces.&nbsp; Each of you 
		have some losses.&nbsp; Each of you have made sacrifices.&nbsp; You come from 
		every conceivable background -- from big cities and small towns, from 
		every race and faith and station.&nbsp; You’ve come together to serve a 
		greater cause, one that matters to the citizens of your country back 
		home and to strangers who live a world away. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So make no mistake, through 
		your service, you demonstrate the content of the American character.&nbsp; 
		Sal is right -- every single one of you is a hero. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some people ask whether 
		America’s best days lie ahead or whether our greatness stretches back 
		behind us in the stories of those who’ve gone before.&nbsp; And when I look 
		out at all of you, I know the answer to that.&nbsp; You give me hope.&nbsp; You 
		give me inspiration.&nbsp; Your resolve shows that Americans will never 
		succumb to fear.&nbsp; Your selfless service shows who we are, who we always 
		will be -- united as one people and united as one nation -- for you 
		embody and stand up for the values that make us what we are as a people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America is not defined by 
		our borders.&nbsp; We are defined by a common creed.&nbsp; In this holiday season, 
		it’s worth remembering that “we hold these truths to be self-evident, 
		that all men are created equal, that we are endowed by our Creator by 
		certain inalienable rights, that among these are the right to life and 
		liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s what you’re 
		fighting for here in Afghanistan, and that’s what you’re protecting back 
		home. And that belief is more powerful than any adversary.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we may face a tough enemy 
		in Afghanistan, and we’re in a period of tough challenges back home, but 
		we did not become the nation that we are because we do what’s easy.&nbsp; As 
		Americans we’ve endured and we’ve grown stronger, and we remain the Land 
		of the Free only because we are also Home of the Brave.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And because of you, I know 
		that once more, we will prevail.&nbsp; So thank you.&nbsp; God bless you, and God 
		bless the United States of America.&nbsp;Hooah! &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, everybody, and 
		Happy New Year.&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.&nbsp; God bless you.</font></p>
