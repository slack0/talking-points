<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you so much.&nbsp; Thank 
		you. Everybody please have a seat.&nbsp; It is wonderful to see all of you. 
		Thank you, Phyllis, for the wonderful introduction.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to thank all the 
		tribal leaders who are here for making this year’s conference the most 
		successful yet.&nbsp; I want to acknowledge outstanding members of my team 
		that have helped pull this together, but, more importantly, day in and 
		day out are thinking about what we can do to make sure that all the 
		tribes that are represented have a voice here in Washington.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First of all, my 
		outstanding Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar.&nbsp; We are so proud of 
		him.&nbsp; Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, Larry Echo Hawk.&nbsp; Hey! And 
		our outstanding solicitor for the Department of Interior, Hilary 
		Tompkins.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, today, I’m here not 
		only as President.&nbsp; As I’ve mentioned before, I am also here as an 
		adopted member of the Crow Nation.&nbsp; So I’d like to recognize my adoptive 
		Mom and Dad, Sonny and Mary Black Eagle, who are backstage.&nbsp; They’re 
		going to be coming out here in a little bit.&nbsp; I’m so grateful they took 
		me into their family.&nbsp; I bet they’re grateful that I never went through 
		the “terrible twos” -- or “terrible teens.”&nbsp; They got me after I was a 
		little more polished.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ken Salazar, he works so 
		hard on the issues that matter to all of you.&nbsp; And we also have members 
		of Congress here as well who are great partners in this effort.&nbsp; And I 
		finally -- I want to give a shout-out to the young people who are here 
		as part of the White House program called “Champions for Change.”&nbsp;Really 
		remarkable young people.&nbsp; I had a chance to meet them backstage.&nbsp; 
		There’s Teressa Baldwin, who’s working to prevent teen suicide among 
		Alaska Natives.&nbsp; LeVon Thomas, who's bringing green jobs to the Navajo 
		Nation.&nbsp; Dallas Duplessis, who started a gardening club to promote 
		healthy eating in Tulalip, Washington.&nbsp; She wrote, “Our goal is not to 
		be couch potatoes, but to grow some potatoes.”&nbsp; I think Michelle would 
		like that one.&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Standing in this room, with leaders of all ages, it’s impossible not to 
		be optimistic about the future of Indian Country.&nbsp; Obviously, we face 
		tough times.&nbsp; But you still believe that tomorrow can be better than 
		today.&nbsp; You’re out there making your communities better places to live.&nbsp; 
		What you expect -- and what you deserve -- is a federal government that 
		helps, not hinders, your efforts.&nbsp; You deserve leaders in Washington who 
		fight for you every single day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s one of the reasons 
		I ran for this office.&nbsp; When I visited the Crow Nation during the 
		campaign, I said my job was not just to win an election; it was to make 
		sure that Washington starts focusing on you.&nbsp; I promised a true 
		government-to-government relationship -- a relationship that recognizes 
		our sometimes painful history, a relationship that respects the unique 
		heritage of Native Americans and that includes you in the dream that we 
		all share.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/tribalnationsconferenceaudience.jpg" width="308" height="192">&nbsp;
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">And together, we're 
		building that relationship.&nbsp; I told you I would bring tribal leaders to 
		Washington to reflect -- to develop an agenda that reflects your hopes 
		and your concerns.&nbsp; And now, for a third year in a row, we have kept 
		that promise. I told you that when I was President, we wouldn’t just pay 
		lip service to the idea of consultation.&nbsp; And today, we're holding every 
		Cabinet agency responsible for working together with Indian tribes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I told you I'd appoint 
		Native Americans to senior positions in the White House.&nbsp; And I know 
		that many of you have worked with Kim Teehee of Cherokee Nation, my 
		senior policy advisor for Native American issues; and Charlie Galbraith 
		of the Navajo Nation, in our office of Intergovernmental Affairs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re working to make our 
		government-to-government relationship even stronger.&nbsp; We asked Congress 
		to recognize the power of tribes to prosecute perpetrators of domestic 
		violence, whether they’re Indian or non-Indian.&nbsp;And in the wake of the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcieri_v._Salazar">
		<font color="#0000FF"><i>Carcieri</i> decision</font></a>, we've asked 
		Congress to restore the Secretary of the Interior’s authority to take 
		land into trust for federally recognized Indian tribes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this new relationship 
		represents a major step forward.&nbsp; It is change.&nbsp; But I promised even 
		more than that.&nbsp; I told you that as President, I would work with you to 
		tackle the most difficult problems facing Native American families.&nbsp; And 
		that’s exactly what we’ve done.&nbsp; We passed the Tribal Law and Order Act, 
		and began making Indian Country a safer place to live.&nbsp; We permanently 
		authorized the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and made quality 
		health care accessible to more Native Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just this week, we 
		streamlined leasing regulations, which will lead to more homes, more 
		businesses, more renewable energy on the reservation.&nbsp; That’s what 
		change is.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, we said that 
		even as we include Indian tribes in the broader promise of America, 
		we're going to keep native traditions alive.&nbsp; So when Michelle launched 
		Let’s Move! in Indian Country, she brought lacrosse players to the White 
		House, and invited Native American children to plant the “three sisters” 
		crops in the White House vegetable garden.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While our work together is 
		far from over, today we can see what change looks like.&nbsp; It's the Native 
		American-owned small business that's opening its doors, or a worker 
		helping a school renovate.&nbsp; It’s new roads and houses.&nbsp; It’s wind 
		turbines going up on tribal lands, and crime going down in tribal 
		communities. That’s what change looks like.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we should be proud of 
		what we’ve done -- together.&nbsp; But of course, that should sharpen our 
		resolve to do even more.&nbsp; Because as long as Native Americans face 
		unemployment and poverty rates that are far higher than the national 
		average, we’re going to have more work to do.&nbsp; And I wake up every day 
		focused on how to get this economy growing and create jobs for every 
		American, faster.&nbsp; We’re working to rebuild an economy where no matter 
		who you are, no matter what you look like -– black, white, Latino, 
		Asian, Native American –- you can make it if you try.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why I proposed 
		the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jobs_Act">
		<font color="#0000FF">American Jobs Act</font></a> -- to help all 
		Americans, including First Americans, make it through these tough 
		times.&nbsp; It’s why my administration has addressed the obstacles that are 
		unique to Indian country by guaranteeing loans for homeowners and small 
		business owners and tribes.&nbsp; It’s why we're working to equip your 
		communities with high-speed Internet access.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And even as we meet at 
		this moment, we have to prepare the next generation for the future -- 
		which is why, earlier today, I signed an executive order to launch the 
		White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Secretary Duncan -- who is 
		here -- Secretary Salazar, they’re going to work together on this effort 
		to prepare Native American youth to compete for the high-skilled, good 
		jobs of tomorrow.&nbsp; We’re going to find ways to reduce the dropout rate.&nbsp; 
		We’re going to help students who've already dropped out re-enter the 
		education system.&nbsp; And we’re going to strengthen our Tribal Colleges and 
		Universities.&nbsp; They are cornerstones of their community and they deserve 
		our support.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we've made progress 
		together.&nbsp; And a lot of that progress is possible because of all of you 
		-- because the ideas that you’ve shared at the last two conferences, and 
		that you’re sharing at this conference.&nbsp; And that’s why I’m looking 
		forward to hearing the results of the discussion that you have today.&nbsp; I 
		want to know what we can do to keep tackling the tough issues -- from 
		education to jobs to health care to public safety.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It would be nice to say 
		that the work was done, but we know the truth.&nbsp; We haven’t solved all 
		our problems.&nbsp; We’ve got a long road ahead.&nbsp; But I believe that one day, 
		we’re going to be able to look back on these years and say that this was 
		a turning point.&nbsp; This was the moment when we began to build a strong 
		middle class in Indian Country; the moment when businesses, large and 
		small, began opening up in reservations; the moment when we stopped 
		repeating the mistakes of the past, and began building a better future 
		together, one that honors old traditions and welcomes every Native 
		American into the American Dream.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ve got to finish what 
		we started.&nbsp; So today, I want to thank all of you for everything that 
		you do.&nbsp; I want to ask you to keep going.&nbsp; And when you go back home, 
		making your communities better places to live, I want you all to know 
		that you’ve got a partner in Washington.&nbsp; You have an administration 
		that understands the challenges that you face and, most importantly, 
		you’ve got a President who’s got your back.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So thank you.&nbsp; God bless 
		you.&nbsp; God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
