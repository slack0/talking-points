		<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#FF0000">[as prepared 
		for delivery]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Madame Speaker, Mr. Vice 
		President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States (who 
		is around here somewhere):</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I have come here tonight not 
		only to address the distinguished men and women in this great chamber, 
		but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us 
		here.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I know that for many 
		Americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that 
		rises above all others. &nbsp;And rightly so.&nbsp; If you haven’t been personally 
		affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has -- a 
		friend; a neighbor; a member of your family.&nbsp; You don’t need to hear 
		another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, 
		because you live it every day.&nbsp; It’s the worry you wake up with and the 
		source of sleepless nights.&nbsp; It’s the job you thought you’d retire from 
		but now have lost; the business you built your dreams upon that’s now 
		hanging by a thread; the college acceptance letter your child had to put 
		back in the envelope.&nbsp; The impact of this recession is real, and it is 
		everywhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But while our economy may be 
		weakened and our confidence shaken; though we are living through 
		difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know 
		this:</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We will rebuild, we will 
		recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than 
		before.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The weight of this crisis 
		will not determine the destiny of this nation.&nbsp; The answers to our 
		problems don’t lie beyond our reach.&nbsp; They exist in our laboratories and 
		universities; in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations of 
		our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on Earth.&nbsp; 
		Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress 
		and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure.&nbsp; What 
		is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly 
		the challenges we face, and take responsibility for our future once 
		more.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, if we’re honest with 
		ourselves, we’ll admit that for too long, we have not always met these 
		responsibilities -- as a government or as a people.&nbsp; I say this not to 
		lay blame or look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how 
		we arrived at this moment that we’ll be able to lift ourselves out of 
		this predicament.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The fact is, our economy did 
		not fall into decline overnight.&nbsp; Nor did all of our problems begin when 
		the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank.&nbsp; We have known 
		for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy.&nbsp; 
		Yet we import more oil today than ever before.&nbsp; The cost of health care 
		eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying 
		reform.&nbsp; Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too 
		many of our schools do not prepare them for.&nbsp; And though all these 
		challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile 
		up more debt, both as individuals and through our government, than ever 
		before.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In other words, we have 
		lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over 
		long-term prosperity; where we failed to look beyond the next payment, 
		the next quarter, or the next election.&nbsp; A surplus became an excuse to 
		transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in 
		our future.&nbsp; Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at 
		the expense of a healthy market.&nbsp; People bought homes they knew they 
		couldn’t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans 
		anyway.&nbsp; And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions 
		were put off for some other time on some other day.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Well that day of reckoning 
		has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now is the time to act 
		boldly and wisely -- to not only revive this economy, but to build a new 
		foundation for lasting prosperity.&nbsp; Now is the time to jumpstart job 
		creation, re-start lending, and invest in areas like energy, health 
		care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard 
		choices to bring our deficit down.&nbsp; That is what my economic agenda is 
		designed to do, and that’s what I’d like to talk to you about tonight.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It’s an agenda that begins 
		with jobs.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As soon as I took office, I 
		asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President’s Day that 
		would put people back to work and put money in their pockets.&nbsp; Not 
		because I believe in bigger government – I don’t.&nbsp; Not because I’m not 
		mindful of the massive debt we’ve inherited – I am.&nbsp; I called for action 
		because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more 
		hardships.&nbsp; In fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term 
		deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years.&nbsp; That’s why I pushed 
		for quick action.&nbsp; And tonight, I am grateful that this Congress 
		delivered, and pleased to say that the American Recovery and 
		Reinvestment Act is now law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Over the next two years, 
		this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.&nbsp; More than 90% of these 
		jobs will be in the private sector – jobs rebuilding our roads and 
		bridges; constructing wind turbines and solar panels; laying broadband 
		and expanding mass transit.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Because of this plan, there 
		are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids.&nbsp; Health 
		care professionals can continue caring for our sick.&nbsp; There are 57 
		police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis tonight 
		because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to 
		make.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Because of this plan, 95% of 
		the working households in America will receive a tax cut -- a tax cut 
		that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Because of this plan, 
		families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 
		tax credit for all four years of college.&nbsp; And Americans who have lost 
		their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended 
		unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them 
		weather this storm.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I know there are some in 
		this chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan 
		will work.&nbsp; I understand that skepticism.&nbsp; Here in Washington, we’ve all 
		seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and 
		wasteful spending.&nbsp; And with a plan of this scale comes enormous 
		responsibility to get it right.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That is why I have asked 
		Vice President Biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort – 
		because nobody messes with Joe.&nbsp; I have told each member of my Cabinet 
		as well as mayors and governors across the country that they will be 
		held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they 
		spend.&nbsp; I have appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to 
		ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud.&nbsp; And we have created a 
		new website called recovery.gov so that every American can find out how 
		and where their money is being spent.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So the recovery plan we 
		passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track.&nbsp; But it 
		is just the first step.&nbsp; Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, 
		there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that 
		has severely weakened our financial system.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I want to speak plainly and 
		candidly about this issue tonight, because every American should know 
		that it directly affects you and your family’s well-being.&nbsp; You should 
		also know that the money you’ve deposited in banks across the country is 
		safe; your insurance is secure; and you can rely on the continued 
		operation of our financial system.&nbsp; That is not the source of concern.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The concern is that if we do 
		not re-start lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off 
		before it even begins.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You see, the flow of credit 
		is the lifeblood of our economy.&nbsp; The ability to get a loan is how you 
		finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college 
		education; how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and 
		businesses make payroll.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But credit has stopped 
		flowing the way it should.&nbsp; Too many bad loans from the housing crisis 
		have made their way onto the books of too many banks.&nbsp; With so much debt 
		and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out any 
		more money to households, to businesses, or to each other.&nbsp; When there 
		is no lending, families can’t afford to buy homes or cars.&nbsp; So 
		businesses are forced to make layoffs.&nbsp; Our economy suffers even more, 
		and credit dries up even further.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That is why this 
		administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this 
		destructive cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We will do so in several 
		ways.&nbsp; First, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the 
		largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small 
		business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy 
		running.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Second, we have launched a 
		housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of 
		foreclosure lower their monthly payments and re-finance their 
		mortgages.&nbsp; It’s a plan that won’t help speculators or that neighbor 
		down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it 
		will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home 
		values – Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower 
		interest rates that this plan has already helped bring about.&nbsp; In fact, 
		the average family who re-finances today can save nearly $2000 per year 
		on their mortgage.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Third, we will act with the 
		full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that 
		Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even 
		in more difficult times.&nbsp; And when we learn that a major bank has 
		serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible, force the 
		necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance 
		sheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that 
		can serve our people and our economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I understand that on any 
		given day, Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives 
		banks bailouts with no strings attached, and that holds nobody 
		accountable for their reckless decisions.&nbsp; But such an approach won’t 
		solve the problem.&nbsp; And our goal is to quicken the day when we re-start 
		lending to the American people and American business and end this crisis 
		once and for all.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I intend to hold these banks 
		fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they 
		will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more 
		lending for the American taxpayer.&nbsp; This time, CEOs won’t be able to use 
		taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear 
		on a private jet.&nbsp; Those days are over.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Still, this plan will 
		require significant resources from the federal government – and yes, 
		probably more than we’ve already set aside.&nbsp; But while the cost of 
		action will be great, I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be 
		far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for 
		not months or years, but perhaps a decade.&nbsp; That would be worse for our 
		deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next 
		generation.&nbsp; And I refuse to let that happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I understand that when the 
		last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for 
		struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the 
		mismanagement and results that followed.&nbsp; So were the American 
		taxpayers.&nbsp; So was I.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So I know how unpopular it 
		is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is 
		suffering in part from their bad decisions.&nbsp; I promise you – I get it.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But I also know that in a 
		time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger, or yield to the 
		politics of the moment.&nbsp; My job – our job – is to solve the problem.&nbsp; 
		Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility.&nbsp; I will not spend a 
		single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street 
		executive, but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business 
		that can’t pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can’t 
		get a mortgage.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That’s what this is about.&nbsp; 
		It’s not about helping banks – it’s about helping people.&nbsp; Because when 
		credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new 
		home.&nbsp; And then some company will hire workers to build it.&nbsp; And then 
		those workers will have money to spend, and if they can get a loan too, 
		maybe they’ll finally buy that car, or open their own business.&nbsp; 
		Investors will return to the market, and American families will see 
		their retirement secured once more.&nbsp; Slowly, but surely, confidence will 
		return, and our economy will recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So I ask this Congress to 
		join me in doing whatever proves necessary.&nbsp; Because we cannot consign 
		our nation to an open-ended recession.&nbsp; And to ensure that a crisis of 
		this magnitude never happens again, I ask Congress to move quickly on 
		legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system.&nbsp; It 
		is time to put in place tough, new common-sense rules of the road so 
		that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes 
		short-cuts and abuse.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The recovery plan and the 
		financial stability plan are the immediate steps we’re taking to revive 
		our economy in the short-term.&nbsp; But the only way to fully restore 
		America’s economic strength is to make the long-term investments that 
		will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete 
		with the rest of the world. The only way this century will be another 
		American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence 
		on oil and the high cost of health care; the schools that aren’t 
		preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit.&nbsp; 
		That is our responsibility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the next few days, I will 
		submit a budget to Congress.&nbsp; So often, we have come to view these 
		documents as simply numbers on a page or laundry lists of programs.&nbsp; I 
		see this document differently.&nbsp; I see it as a vision for America – as a 
		blueprint for our future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">My budget does not attempt 
		to solve every problem or address every issue.&nbsp; It reflects the stark 
		reality of what we’ve inherited – a trillion dollar deficit, a financial 
		crisis, and a costly recession.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Given these realities, 
		everyone in this chamber – Democrats and Republicans – will have to 
		sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars.&nbsp; And 
		that includes me. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But that does not mean we 
		can afford to ignore our long-term challenges.&nbsp; I reject the view that 
		says our problems will simply take care of themselves; that says 
		government has no role in laying the foundation for our common 
		prosperity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For history tells a 
		different story.&nbsp; History reminds us that at every moment of economic 
		upheaval and transformation, this nation has responded with bold action 
		and big ideas.&nbsp; In the midst of civil war, we laid railroad tracks from 
		one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry.&nbsp; From the 
		turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high 
		schools that prepared our citizens for a new age.&nbsp; In the wake of war 
		and depression, the GI Bill sent a generation to college and created the 
		largest middle-class in history.&nbsp; And a twilight struggle for freedom 
		led to a nation of highways, an American on the moon, and an explosion 
		of technology that still shapes our world.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In each case, government 
		didn’t supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise.&nbsp; It 
		created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses 
		to adapt and to thrive.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We are a nation that has 
		seen promise amid peril, and claimed opportunity from ordeal.&nbsp; Now we 
		must be that nation again.&nbsp; That is why, even as it cuts back on the 
		programs we don’t need, the budget I submit will invest in the three 
		areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future:&nbsp; energy, 
		health care, and education.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It begins with energy.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We know the country that 
		harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st 
		century.&nbsp; And yet, it is China that has launched the largest effort in 
		history to make their economy energy efficient.&nbsp; We invented solar 
		technology, but we’ve fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in 
		producing it.&nbsp; New plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they 
		will run on batteries made in Korea.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Well I do not accept a 
		future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our 
		borders – and I know you don’t either.&nbsp; It is time for America to lead 
		again.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Thanks to our recovery plan, 
		we will double this nation’s supply of renewable energy in the next 
		three years.&nbsp; We have also made the largest investment in basic research 
		funding in American history – an investment that will spur not only new 
		discoveries in energy, but breakthroughs in medicine, science, and 
		technology.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We will soon lay down 
		thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities 
		and towns across this country.&nbsp; And we will put Americans to work making 
		our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of 
		dollars on our energy bills.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But to truly transform our 
		economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of 
		climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the 
		profitable kind of energy.&nbsp; So I ask this Congress to send me 
		legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and 
		drives the production of more renewable energy in America.&nbsp; And to 
		support that innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year 
		to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced 
		biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built 
		right here in America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As for our auto industry, 
		everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and a global 
		recession have pushed our automakers to the brink.&nbsp; We should not, and 
		will not, protect them from their own bad practices.&nbsp; But we are 
		committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can 
		compete and win.&nbsp; Millions of jobs depend on it.&nbsp; Scores of communities 
		depend on it.&nbsp; And I believe the nation that invented the automobile 
		cannot walk away from it.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">None of this will come 
		without cost, nor will it be easy.&nbsp; But this is America.&nbsp; We don’t do 
		what’s easy.&nbsp; We do what is necessary to move this country forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For that same reason, we 
		must also address the crushing cost of health care.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This is a cost that now 
		causes a bankruptcy in America every thirty seconds.&nbsp; By the end of the 
		year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their homes.&nbsp; In the 
		last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages.&nbsp; And 
		in each of these years, one million more Americans have lost their 
		health insurance.&nbsp; It is one of the major reasons why small businesses 
		close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas.&nbsp; And it’s one of 
		the largest and fastest-growing parts of our budget.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Given these facts, we can no 
		longer afford to put health care reform on hold.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Already, we have done more 
		to advance the cause of health care reform in the last thirty days than 
		we have in the last decade.&nbsp; When it was days old, this Congress passed 
		a law to provide and protect health insurance for eleven million 
		American children whose parents work full-time.&nbsp; Our recovery plan will 
		invest in electronic health records and new technology that will reduce 
		errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives.&nbsp; It will 
		launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of 
		nearly every American by seeking a cure for cancer in our time.&nbsp; And it 
		makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that is 
		one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under 
		control.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This budget builds on these 
		reforms.&nbsp; It includes an historic commitment to comprehensive health 
		care reform – a down-payment on the principle that we must have quality, 
		affordable health care for every American.&nbsp; It’s a commitment that’s 
		paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue.&nbsp; 
		And it’s a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the 
		years to come.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, there will be many 
		different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that is 
		why I’m bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health 
		care providers, Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue 
		next week.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I suffer no illusions that 
		this will be an easy process.&nbsp; It will be hard.&nbsp; But I also know that 
		nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform, the cost 
		of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of 
		our nation long enough.&nbsp; So let there be no doubt: health care reform 
		cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The third challenge we must 
		address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in 
		America.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In a global economy where 
		the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education 
		is no longer just a pathway to opportunity – it is a pre-requisite.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Right now, three-quarters of 
		the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school 
		diploma.&nbsp; And yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of 
		education.&nbsp; We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any 
		industrialized nation.&nbsp; And half of the students who begin college never 
		finish.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This is a prescription for 
		economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today 
		will out-compete us tomorrow.&nbsp; That is why it will be the goal of this 
		administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and 
		competitive education – from the day they are born to the day they begin 
		a career.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Already, we have made an 
		historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan.&nbsp; We 
		have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue 
		to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning 
		comes in those first years of life.&nbsp; We have made college affordable for 
		nearly seven million more students.&nbsp; And we have provided the resources 
		necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set 
		back our children’s progress.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But we know that our schools 
		don’t just need more resources.&nbsp; They need more reform.&nbsp; That is why 
		this budget creates new incentives for teacher performance; pathways for 
		advancement, and rewards for success.&nbsp; We’ll invest in innovative 
		programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close 
		achievement gaps.&nbsp; And we will expand our commitment to charter 
		schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It is our responsibility as 
		lawmakers and educators to make this system work.&nbsp; But it is the 
		responsibility of every citizen to participate in it.&nbsp; And so tonight, I 
		ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher 
		education or career training.&nbsp; This can be community college or a 
		four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship.&nbsp; But 
		whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than 
		a high school diploma.&nbsp; And dropping out of high school is no longer an 
		option.&nbsp; It’s not just quitting on yourself, it’s quitting on your 
		country – and this country needs and values the talents of every 
		American.&nbsp; That is why we will provide the support necessary for you to 
		complete college and meet a new goal:&nbsp; by 2020, America will once again 
		have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I know that the price of 
		tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to 
		volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve 
		your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education.&nbsp; 
		And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and 
		future generations, I ask this Congress to send me the bipartisan 
		legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch as well as an 
		American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country – 
		Senator Edward Kennedy.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">These education policies 
		will open the doors of opportunity for our children.&nbsp; But it is up to us 
		to ensure they walk through them.&nbsp; In the end, there is no program or 
		policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend those 
		parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after dinner, or turn 
		off the TV, put away the video games, and read to their child.&nbsp; I speak 
		to you not just as a President, but as a father when I say that 
		responsibility for our children's education must begin at home.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">There is, of course, another 
		responsibility we have to our children.&nbsp; And that is the responsibility 
		to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay.&nbsp; With 
		the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the 
		long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to 
		ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this 
		deficit down. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I’m proud that we passed the 
		recovery plan free of earmarks, and I want to pass a budget next year 
		that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important 
		national priorities.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Yesterday, I held a fiscal 
		summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first 
		term in office.&nbsp; My administration has also begun to go line by line 
		through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and 
		ineffective programs.&nbsp; As you can imagine, this is a process that will 
		take some time.&nbsp; But we’re starting with the biggest lines.&nbsp; We have 
		already identified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In this budget, we will end 
		education programs that don’t work and end direct payments to large 
		agribusinesses that don’t need them.&nbsp; We’ll eliminate the no-bid 
		contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and reform our defense 
		budget so that we’re not paying for Cold War-era weapons systems we 
		don’t use.&nbsp; We will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse in our Medicare 
		program that doesn’t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore 
		a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the 
		tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to save our 
		children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the 
		wealthiest 2% of Americans.&nbsp; But let me perfectly clear, because I know 
		you’ll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means 
		a massive tax increase on the American people:&nbsp; if your family earns 
		less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a 
		single dime.&nbsp; I repeat: not one single dime.&nbsp; In fact, the recovery plan 
		provides a tax cut – that’s right, a tax cut – for 95% of working 
		families.&nbsp; And these checks are on the way.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">To preserve our long-term 
		fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and 
		Social Security.&nbsp; Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to 
		strengthen Medicare for years to come.&nbsp; And we must also begin a 
		conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating 
		tax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally, because we’re also 
		suffering from a deficit of trust, I am committed to restoring a sense 
		of honesty and accountability to our budget.&nbsp; That is why this budget 
		looks ahead ten years and accounts for spending that was left out under 
		the old rules – and for the first time, that includes the full cost of 
		fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; For seven years, we have been a 
		nation at war.&nbsp; No longer will we hide its price.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We are now carefully 
		reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon announce a way 
		forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this 
		war.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And with our friends and 
		allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan 
		and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda and combat extremism.&nbsp; Because I will 
		not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe 
		havens half a world away.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As we meet here tonight, our 
		men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to 
		deploy. To each and every one of them, and to the families who bear the 
		quiet burden of their absence, Americans are united in sending one 
		message: we honor your service, we are inspired by your sacrifice, and 
		you have our unyielding support.&nbsp; To relieve the strain on our forces, 
		my budget increases the number of our soldiers and Marines. And to keep 
		our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay, and give 
		our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have 
		earned.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">To overcome extremism, we 
		must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend – 
		because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of 
		America. That is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center 
		at Guantanamo Bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured 
		terrorists – because living our values doesn’t make us weaker, it makes 
		us safer and it makes us stronger.&nbsp; And that is why I can stand here 
		tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States 
		of America does not torture.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In words and deeds, we are 
		showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun.&nbsp; For we know 
		that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the 
		world cannot meet them without America.&nbsp; We cannot shun the negotiating 
		table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm.&nbsp; We are 
		instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor 
		that serious times demand.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">To seek progress toward a 
		secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors, we have 
		appointed an envoy to sustain our effort.&nbsp; To meet the challenges of the 
		21st century – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation; from pandemic 
		disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty – we will strengthen old 
		alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And to respond to an 
		economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations 
		of the G-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the 
		possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for American 
		goods in markets across the globe.&nbsp; For the world depends on us to have 
		a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the 
		world’s.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As we stand at this 
		crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once 
		again upon us – watching to see what we do with this moment; waiting for 
		us to lead.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Those of us gathered here 
		tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times.&nbsp; It is a 
		tremendous burden, but also a great privilege – one that has been 
		entrusted to few generations of Americans.&nbsp; For in our hands lies the 
		ability to shape our world for good or for ill.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I know that it is easy to 
		lose sight of this truth – to become cynical and doubtful; consumed with 
		the petty and the trivial.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">But in my life, I have also 
		learned that hope is found in unlikely places; that inspiration often 
		comes not from those with the most power or celebrity, but from the 
		dreams and aspirations of Americans who are anything but ordinary.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I think about Leonard Abess, 
		the bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, 
		took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked 
		for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him.&nbsp; He didn’t tell 
		anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said, ''I knew 
		some of these people since I was 7 years old.&nbsp; I didn't feel right 
		getting the money myself.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I think about Greensburg, 
		Kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado, but is being 
		rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can 
		power an entire community – how it can bring jobs and businesses to a 
		place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay.&nbsp; &quot;The tragedy was 
		terrible,&quot; said one of the men who helped them rebuild.&nbsp; &quot;But the folks 
		here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And I think about Ty’Sheoma 
		Bethea, the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon, South 
		Carolina – a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the 
		walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train 
		barrels by their classroom.&nbsp; She has been told that her school is 
		hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library 
		and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this room.&nbsp; She even 
		asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp.&nbsp; The letter asks us 
		for help, and says, &quot;We are just students trying to become lawyers, 
		doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day president, so we can make 
		a change to not just the state of South Carolina but also the world.&nbsp; We 
		are not quitters.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We are not quitters.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">These words and these 
		stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us 
		here.&nbsp; They tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the most 
		difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency, 
		and a determination that perseveres; a willingness to take 
		responsibility for our future and for posterity.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Their resolve must be our 
		inspiration.&nbsp; Their concerns must be our cause.&nbsp; And we must show them 
		and all our people that we are equal to the task before us.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I know that we haven’t 
		agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the future 
		when we will part ways.&nbsp; But I also know that every American who is 
		sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed.&nbsp; That 
		must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming 
		months, and where we return after those debates are done.&nbsp; That is the 
		foundation on which the American people expect us to build common 
		ground.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">And if we do – if we come 
		together and lift this nation from the depths of this crisis; if we put 
		our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity; if we 
		confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that 
		enduring spirit of an America that does not quit, then someday years 
		from now our children can tell their children that this was the time 
		when we performed, in the words that are carved into this very chamber, 
		&quot;something worthy to be remembered.&quot;&nbsp; Thank you, God Bless you, and may 
		God Bless the United States of America.</font></p>
