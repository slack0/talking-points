<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good morning, 
		everybody.&nbsp;Please have a seat.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A week ago today, I sent 
		Congress the American Jobs Act.&nbsp; It’s a plan that will lead to new jobs 
		for teachers, for construction workers, for veterans, and for the 
		unemployed.&nbsp; It will cut taxes for every small business owner and 
		virtually every working man and woman in America.&nbsp; And the proposals in 
		this jobs bill are the kinds that have been supported by Democrats and 
		Republicans in the past.&nbsp; So there shouldn’t be any reason for Congress 
		to drag its feet.&nbsp; They should pass it right away.&nbsp; I'm ready to sign a 
		bill.&nbsp; I've got the pens all ready.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, as I said before, 
		Congress should pass this bill knowing that every proposal is fully paid 
		for.&nbsp; The American Jobs Act will not add to our nation’s debt.&nbsp; And 
		today, I’m releasing a plan that details how to pay for the jobs bill 
		while also paying down our debt over time.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is important, 
		because the health of our economy depends in part on what we do right 
		now to create the conditions where businesses can hire and middle-class 
		families can feel a basic measure of economic security.&nbsp; But in the long 
		run, our prosperity also depends on our ability to pay down the massive 
		debt we’ve accumulated over the past decade in a way that allows us to 
		meet our responsibilities to each other and to the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">During this past decade, 
		profligate spending in Washington, tax cuts for multi-millionaires and 
		billionaires, the cost of two wars, and the recession turned a record 
		surplus into a yawning deficit, and that left us with a big pile of 
		IOUs.&nbsp; If we don’t act, that burden will ultimately fall on our 
		children’s shoulders.&nbsp; If we don’t act, the growing debt will eventually 
		crowd out everything else, preventing us from investing in things like 
		education, or sustaining programs like Medicare.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So Washington has to live 
		within its means.&nbsp; The government has to do what families across this 
		country have been doing for years.&nbsp; We have to cut what we can’t afford 
		to pay for what really matters.&nbsp; We need to invest in what will promote 
		hiring and economic growth now while still providing the confidence that 
		will come with a plan that reduces our deficits over the long-term.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		These principles were at the heart of the deficit framework that I put 
		forward in April.&nbsp; It was an approach to shrink the deficit as a share 
		of the economy, but not to do so so abruptly with spending cuts that 
		would hamper growth or prevent us from helping small businesses and 
		middle-class families get back on their feet.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was an approach that 
		said we need to go through the budget line-by-line looking for waste, 
		without shortchanging education and basic scientific research and road 
		construction, because those things are essential to our future.&nbsp; And it 
		was an approach that said we shouldn't balance the budget on the backs 
		of the poor and the middle class; that for us to solve this problem, 
		everybody, including the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations, 
		have to pay their fair share.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, during the debt 
		ceiling debate, I had hoped to negotiate a compromise with the Speaker 
		of the House that fulfilled these principles and achieved the $4 
		trillion in deficit reduction that leaders in both parties have agreed 
		we need -- a grand bargain that would have strengthened our economy, 
		instead of weakened it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Speaker walked away from a 
		balanced package.&nbsp; What we agreed to instead wasn’t all that grand.&nbsp; But 
		it was a start -- roughly $1 trillion in cuts to domestic spending and 
		defense spending.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Everyone knows we have to 
		do more, and a special joint committee of Congress is assigned to find 
		more deficit reduction. So, today, I’m laying out a set of specific 
		proposals to finish what we started this summer -- proposals that live 
		up to the principles I’ve talked about from the beginning.&nbsp; It’s a plan 
		that reduces our debt by more than $4 trillion, and achieves these 
		savings in a way that is fair -- by asking everybody to do their part so 
		that no one has to bear too much of the burden on their own.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All told, this plan cuts 
		$2 in spending for every dollar in new revenues.&nbsp; In addition to the $1 
		trillion in spending that we’ve already cut from the budget, our plan 
		makes additional spending cuts that need to happen if we’re to solve 
		this problem. We reform agricultural subsidies -- subsidies that a lot 
		of times pay large farms for crops that they don't grow.&nbsp; We make modest 
		adjustments to federal retirement programs.&nbsp; We reduce by tens of 
		billions of dollars the tax money that goes to Fannie Mae and Freddie 
		Mac.&nbsp; We also ask the largest financial firms -- companies saved by tax 
		dollars during the financial crisis -- to repay the American people for 
		every dime that we spent.&nbsp; And we save an additional $1 trillion as we 
		end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These savings are not only 
		counted as part of our plan, but as part of the budget plan that nearly 
		every Republican on the House voted for.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, this plan 
		includes structural reforms to reduce the cost of health care in 
		programs like Medicare and Medicaid.&nbsp; Keep in mind we've already 
		included a number of reforms in the health care law, which will go a 
		long way towards controlling these costs.&nbsp; But we're going to have to do 
		a little more.&nbsp; This plan reduces wasteful subsidies and erroneous 
		payments while changing some incentives that often lead to excessive 
		health care costs.&nbsp; It makes prescriptions more affordable through 
		faster approval of generic drugs.&nbsp; We’ll work with governors to make 
		Medicaid more efficient and more accountable.&nbsp; And we’ll change the way 
		we pay for health care.&nbsp; Instead of just paying for procedures, 
		providers will be paid more when they improve results -- and such steps 
		will save money and improve care.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These changes are phased 
		in slowly to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid over time.&nbsp; Because while 
		we do need to reduce health care costs, I’m not going to allow that to 
		be an excuse for turning Medicare into a voucher program that leaves 
		seniors at the mercy of the insurance industry.&nbsp; And I'm not going to 
		stand for balancing the budget by denying or reducing health care for 
		poor children or those with disabilities.&nbsp; So we will reform Medicare 
		and Medicaid, but we will not abandon the fundamental commitment that 
		this country has kept for generations.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And by the way, that 
		includes our commitment to Social Security.&nbsp; I've said before, Social 
		Security is not the primary cause of our deficits, but it does face 
		long-term challenges as our country grows older.&nbsp; And both parties are 
		going to need to work together on a separate track to strengthen Social 
		Security for our children and our grandchildren.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So this is how we can 
		reduce spending:&nbsp; by scouring the budget for every dime of waste and 
		inefficiency, by reforming government spending, and by making modest 
		adjustments to Medicare and Medicaid.&nbsp; But all these reductions in 
		spending, by themselves, will not solve our fiscal problems.&nbsp; We can’t 
		just cut our way out of this hole.&nbsp; It’s going to take a balanced 
		approach.&nbsp; If we’re going to make spending cuts -- many of which we 
		wouldn’t make if we weren’t facing such large budget deficits -- then 
		it’s only right that we ask everyone to pay their fair share.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, last week, 
		Speaker of the House John Boehner gave a speech about the economy.&nbsp; And 
		to his credit, he made the point that we can’t afford the kind of 
		politics that says it’s “my way or the highway.”&nbsp; I was encouraged by 
		that.&nbsp; Here’s the problem: In that same speech, he also came out against 
		any plan to cut the deficit that includes any additional revenues 
		whatsoever.&nbsp; He said -- I'm quoting him -- there is “only one option.”&nbsp; 
		And that option and only option relies entirely on cuts.&nbsp; That means 
		slashing education, surrendering the research necessary to keep 
		America’s technological edge in the 21st century, and allowing our 
		critical public assets like highways and bridges and airports to get 
		worse.&nbsp; It would cripple our competiveness and our ability to win the 
		jobs of the future.&nbsp; And it would also mean asking sacrifice of seniors 
		and the middle class and the poor, while asking nothing of the 
		wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So the Speaker says we can’t have it &quot;my way or the highway,&quot; and then 
		basically says, my way -- or the highway.&nbsp; That’s not 
		smart.&nbsp; It’s not right.&nbsp; If we’re going to meet our responsibilities, we 
		have to do it together.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I’m proposing real, 
		serious cuts in spending.&nbsp; When you include the $1 trillion in cuts I’ve 
		already signed into law, these would be among the biggest cuts in 
		spending in our history. But they’ve got to be part of a larger plan 
		that’s balanced –- a plan that asks the most fortunate among us to pay 
		their fair share, just like everybody else.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s why this plan 
		eliminates tax loopholes that primarily go to the wealthiest taxpayers 
		and biggest corporations –- tax breaks that small businesses and 
		middle-class families don’t get.&nbsp; And if tax reform doesn't get done, 
		this plan asks the wealthiest Americans to go back to paying the same 
		rates that they paid during the 1990s, before the Bush tax cuts.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I promise it’s not because 
		anybody looks forward to the prospects of raising taxes or paying more 
		taxes.&nbsp; I don’t.&nbsp; In fact, I’ve cut taxes for the middle class and for 
		small businesses, and through the American Jobs Act, we’d cut taxes 
		again to promote hiring and put more money into the pockets of people.&nbsp; 
		But we can’t afford these special lower rates for the wealthy -– rates, 
		by the way, that were meant to be temporary.&nbsp; Back when these first -- 
		these tax cuts, back in 2001, 2003, were being talked about, they were 
		talked about temporary measures.&nbsp; We can’t afford them when we’re 
		running these big deficits.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I am also ready to 
		work with Democrats and Republicans to reform our entire tax code, to 
		get rid of the decades of accumulated loopholes, special interest 
		carve-outs, and other tax expenditures that stack the deck against small 
		business owners and ordinary families who can’t afford Washington 
		lobbyists or fancy accountants.&nbsp; Our tax code is more than 10,000 pages 
		long. If you stack up all the volumes, they’re almost five feet tall.&nbsp; 
		That means that how much you pay often depends less on what you make and 
		more on how well you can game the system, and that's especially true of 
		the corporate tax code.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ve got one of the 
		highest corporate tax rates in the world, but it’s riddled with 
		exceptions and special interest loopholes.&nbsp; So some companies get out 
		paying a lot of taxes, while the rest of them end up having to foot the 
		bill.&nbsp; And this makes our entire economy less competitive and our 
		country a less desirable place to do business.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That has to change.&nbsp; Our 
		tax code shouldn’t give an advantage to companies with the 
		best-connected lobbyists.&nbsp; It should give an advantage to companies that 
		invest in the United States of America and create jobs in the United 
		States of America.&nbsp; And we can lower the corporate rate if we get rid of 
		all these special deals.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I am ready, I am eager, 
		to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the tax code to make it 
		simpler, make it fairer, and make America more competitive.&nbsp; But any 
		reform plan will have to raise revenue to help close our deficit.&nbsp; That 
		has to be part of the formula.&nbsp; And any reform should follow another 
		simple principle:&nbsp; Middle-class families shouldn’t pay higher taxes than 
		millionaires and billionaires.&nbsp; That’s pretty straightforward.&nbsp; It’s 
		hard to argue against that.&nbsp; Warren Buffett’s secretary shouldn’t pay a 
		higher tax rate than Warren Buffett.&nbsp; There is no justification for it.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is wrong that in the 
		United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker 
		who earns $50,000 should pay higher tax rates than somebody pulling in 
		$50 million.&nbsp; Anybody who says we can’t change the tax code to correct 
		that, anyone who has signed some pledge to protect every single tax 
		loophole so long as they live, they should be called out.&nbsp; They should 
		have to defend that unfairness -- explain why somebody who's making&nbsp; $50 
		million a year in the financial markets should be paying 15 percent on 
		their taxes, when a teacher making $50,000 a year is paying more than 
		that -- paying a higher rate.&nbsp; They ought to have to answer for it.&nbsp; And 
		if they’re pledged to keep that kind of unfairness in place, they should 
		remember, the last time I checked the only pledge that really matters is 
		the pledge we take to uphold the Constitution.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, we’re already hearing 
		the usual defenders of these kinds of loopholes saying this is just 
		“class warfare.”&nbsp; I reject the idea that asking a hedge fund manager to 
		pay the same tax rate as a plumber or a teacher is class warfare.&nbsp; I 
		think it’s just the right the thing to do.&nbsp; I believe the American 
		middle class, who've been pressured relentlessly for decades, believe 
		it’s time that they were fought for as hard as the lobbyists and some 
		lawmakers have fought to protect special treatment for billionaires and 
		big corporations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nobody wants to punish 
		success in America.&nbsp; What’s great about this country is our belief that 
		anyone can make it and everybody should be able to try -– the idea that 
		any one of us can open a business or have an idea and make us 
		millionaires or billionaires.&nbsp; This is the land of opportunity.&nbsp; That’s 
		great.&nbsp; All I’m saying is that those who have done well, including me, 
		should pay our fair share in taxes to contribute to the nation that made 
		our success possible.&nbsp; We shouldn’t get a better deal than ordinary 
		families get.&nbsp; And I think most wealthy Americans would agree if they 
		knew this would help us grow the economy and deal with the debt that 
		threatens our future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It comes down to this:&nbsp; We 
		have to prioritize.&nbsp; Both parties agree that we need to reduce the 
		deficit by the same amount -- by $4 trillion.&nbsp; So what choices are we 
		going to make to reach that goal?&nbsp; Either we ask the wealthiest 
		Americans to pay their fair share in taxes, or we’re going to have to 
		ask seniors to pay more for Medicare.&nbsp; We can’t afford to do both.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Either we gut education 
		and medical research, or we’ve got to reform the tax code so that the 
		most profitable corporations have to give up tax loopholes that other 
		companies don’t get.&nbsp; We can’t afford to do both.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is not class 
		warfare.&nbsp; It’s math.&nbsp; The money is going to have to come 
		from someplace.&nbsp; And if we’re not willing to ask those who've done 
		extraordinarily well to help America close the deficit and we are trying 
		to reach that same target of $4 trillion, then the logic, the math says 
		everybody else has to do a whole lot more:&nbsp; We’ve got to put the entire 
		burden on the middle class and the poor.&nbsp; We’ve got to scale back on the 
		investments that have always helped our economy grow.&nbsp; We’ve got to 
		settle for second-rate roads and second-rate bridges and second-rate 
		airports, and schools that are crumbling.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s unacceptable to 
		me.&nbsp; That’s unacceptable to the American people.&nbsp; And it will not happen 
		on my watch.&nbsp; I will not support -- I will not support -- any plan that 
		puts all the burden for closing our deficit on ordinary Americans.&nbsp; And 
		I will veto any bill that changes benefits for those who rely on 
		Medicare but does not raise serious revenues by asking the wealthiest 
		Americans or biggest corporations to pay their fair share.&nbsp; We are not 
		going to have a one-sided deal that hurts the folks who are most 
		vulnerable.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">None of the changes I’m 
		proposing are easy or politically convenient.&nbsp; It’s always more popular 
		to promise the moon and leave the bill for after the next election or 
		the election after that.&nbsp; That’s been true since our founding.&nbsp; George 
		Washington grappled with this problem.&nbsp; He said, “Towards the payment of 
		debts, there must be revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; 
		[and] no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient 
		and unpleasant.”&nbsp; He understood that dealing with the debt is -- these 
		are his words -- “always a choice of difficulties.”&nbsp; But he also knew 
		that public servants weren’t elected to do what was easy; they weren’t 
		elected to do what was politically advantageous.&nbsp; It’s our 
		responsibility to put country before party.&nbsp; It’s our responsibility to 
		do what’s right for the future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that’s what this 
		debate is about.&nbsp; It’s not about numbers on a ledger; it’s not about 
		figures on a spreadsheet.&nbsp; It’s about the economic future of this 
		country, and it’s about whether we will do what it takes to create jobs 
		and growth and opportunity while facing up to the legacy of debt that 
		threatens everything we’ve built over generations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it’s also about 
		fairness.&nbsp; It’s about whether we are, in fact, in this together, and 
		we’re looking out for one another.&nbsp; We know what’s right.&nbsp; It’s time to
