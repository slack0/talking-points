transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, Miami Dade!&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;Please, everyone, be seated.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hafeeza, thank you for 
		that wonderful introduction.&nbsp;To Dr. Padrón, Dr. Vicente, to the board of 
		trustees, the faculty, parents, family, friends, and, most important, 
		the class of 2011, congratulations -- congratulations on reaching this 
		day.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And thank you for allowing 
		me the profound honor of being a part of it. And thank you for my first 
		honorary associate degree.&nbsp;One of the perks of this job is that degrees 
		come free these days.&nbsp; Not that it impresses anybody at home.&nbsp; Now 
		Michelle just says, “Hey, Doctor, go take that dog for a walk.”&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is such a thrill to be 
		at one of the largest, most diverse institutions of higher learning in 
		America -- one that just this week was named one of the top community 
		colleges in the nation.&nbsp;More than 170,000 students study across your 
		eight campuses. You come from 181 countries, represented by the flags 
		that just marched across this stage.&nbsp;You speak 94 languages.&nbsp;About 90 
		percent of you are minorities.&nbsp; And because more than 90 percent of you 
		find a job in your field of study, it’s fitting that your motto is 
		“Opportunity changes everything.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As someone who’s only here 
		because of the chances my education gave me, I couldn’t agree 
		more.&nbsp;Opportunity changes everything.&nbsp;America will only be as strong in 
		this new century as the opportunities that we provide you -- the 
		opportunities that we provide to all our young people -- Latino, black, 
		white, Asian, Native American, everybody.&nbsp;America will only be as strong 
		as our pursuit of scientific research and our leadership in technology 
		and innovation.&nbsp;And I believe that community colleges like this one are 
		critical pathways to the middle class that equip students with the 
		skills and the education necessary to compete and win in this 
		21st-century economy.&nbsp;And that’s why I’ve made community colleges a 
		centerpiece of my education agenda, along with helping more students 
		afford college.&nbsp;I couldn’t be prouder of the work we’ve done in 
		community colleges.&nbsp;And your accomplishment today is vital to America 
		reclaiming the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 
		2020.&nbsp; So I am proud of you.&nbsp;I am proud of you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know that for many of 
		you reaching this day wasn’t easy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">AUDIENCE:&nbsp; No.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRESIDENT:&nbsp; See?&nbsp; I 
		got some amens there.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps you’re the first 
		in your family to go to college. Some of you have had to overcome big 
		obstacles, defeat your own doubts, prove yourself to everyone who ever 
		believed that you couldn’t make it because of what you look like or 
		where you came from.&nbsp; And, of course -- of course, for so many of you, 
		this day represents the fulfillment of your family’s dreams when you 
		were born.&nbsp; This is their achievement as well, so give it up for your 
		parents and your grandparents, your cousins and your uncles and your 
		aunties. This is their day, too.&nbsp; This is their day, too.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">See, the diploma you’re 
		about to receive stands for something more than the investment you made 
		in yourselves.&nbsp; It’s the result of an investment made by generations 
		before you; an investment in that radical yet simple idea that America 
		is a place -- the place -- where you can make it if you try.&nbsp;That’s the 
		ideal that has made this country -- that’s the idea that’s represented 
		by that one flag that all of you cheered for; that’s what has made us a 
		shining light to the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And preserving this idea 
		-- keeping the American Dream alive from one generation to the next -- 
		that’s never been an easy task.&nbsp;It’s an even greater test in times of 
		rapid change.&nbsp;And all of you are graduating at a moment when change is 
		coming faster than ever before. We’re emerging from an economic downturn 
		like we haven’t seen since the 1930s.&nbsp;Massive shifts in technology have 
		shifted profoundly what our economy looks like.&nbsp;Massive shifts abroad 
		geopolitically have swift and dramatic impacts not only overseas but 
		also here at home, from markets on Wall Street to wallets on Main 
		Street.&nbsp;Just as advances in technology have the power to make our lives 
		better, they also force us to compete with other nations like never 
		before.&nbsp; Tackling big challenges like terrorism and climate change 
		require sustained national effort, and yet too often, our politics seems 
		as broken, as divided as ever.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I know that for many of 
		you it’s an intimidating time to be marching out into the 
		world.&nbsp;Everything seems so unsettled.&nbsp;The future may seem unclear.&nbsp;But 
		as you make your way in this ever changing world, you should take 
		comfort in knowing that as a country, we’ve navigated tougher times 
		before.&nbsp;We’ve sailed stormier seas.&nbsp; Earlier today, I spent some time in 
		Tuscaloosa, Alabama. And some of you have seen what happened there as a 
		consequence of the tornadoes that struck.&nbsp;The mayor and I visited a 
		community where the devastation from this storm was simply heartbreaking 
		-- entire homes and blocks just gone, wiped away.&nbsp;Some families lost 
		everything.&nbsp;Some families lost family.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But what was striking is 
		the way that damaged community has come together, how they’ve rallied 
		around one another. The mayor there, young man doing wonderful work, 
		Mayor Maddox, he put it best.&nbsp;He told me that when disasters like this 
		strike, all our grievances seem to go away.&nbsp;All our differences don’t 
		seem to matter.&nbsp;All our political disagreements seem so petty.&nbsp;We help 
		each other, we support one another, as one country, as one people.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s the American 
		spirit.&nbsp;No matter how hard we are tested, we look to our faith and our 
		faith in one another.&nbsp;No matter what the challenge, we’ve always carried 
		the American Dream forward. That’s been true throughout our history.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When bombs fell on Pearl 
		Harbor, when an Iron Curtain fell over Europe, when the threat of 
		nuclear war loomed just 90 miles from this city, when a brilliant 
		September morning was darkened by terror -- in none of those instances 
		did we falter. We endured.&nbsp;We carried the dream forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ve gone through periods 
		of great economic turmoil, from an economy where most people worked on 
		farms to one where most people worked in factories to now one fueled by 
		information and technology.&nbsp;Through it all, we’ve persevered.&nbsp;We’ve 
		adapted.&nbsp;We’ve prospered. Workers found their voice, and the right to 
		organize for fair wages and safe working conditions.&nbsp;We carried forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When waves of Irish and 
		Italian immigrants were derided as criminals and outcasts; when 
		Catholics were discriminated against, or Jews had to succumb to quotas, 
		or Muslims were blamed for society’s ills; when blacks were treated as 
		second-class citizens and marriages like my own parents’ were illegal in 
		much of the country -- we didn’t stop.&nbsp;We didn’t accept inequality.&nbsp;We 
		fought.&nbsp;We overcame. We carried the dream forward.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have carried this dream 
		forward through times when our politics seemed broken.&nbsp; This is not the 
		first time where it looked like politicians were going crazy.&nbsp;In heated 
		debates over our founding, some warned independence would doom America 
		to “a scene of bloody discord and desolation for ages.”&nbsp;That was the 
		warning about independence.&nbsp;One of our greatest Presidents, Thomas 
		Jefferson, was labeled an “infidel” and a “howling atheist” with 
		“fangs.”&nbsp;Think about that.&nbsp;Even I haven’t gotten that one yet.&nbsp;Lincoln 
		-- Lincoln, FDR, they were both vilified in their own times as tyrants, 
		power hungry, bent on destroying democracy.&nbsp;And of course, this state 
		has seen its fair share of tightly contested elections.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And we’ve made it through 
		those moments.&nbsp;None of it was easy.&nbsp;A lot of it was messy.&nbsp;Sometimes 
		there was violence.&nbsp;Sometimes it took years, even decades, for us to 
		find our way through. But here’s the thing.&nbsp;We made it through.&nbsp;We made 
		it through because in each of those moments, we made a choice.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rather than turn inward 
		and wall off America from the rest of the world, we’ve chosen to stand 
		up forcefully for the ideals and the rights we believe are universal for 
		all men and women.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rather than settle for an 
		America where everybody is left to fend for themselves, where we think 
		only about our own short-term needs instead of the country that we’re 
		leaving to our children, we have chosen to build a nation where 
		everybody has a shot at opportunity, where everyone can succeed.&nbsp;We’ve 
		chosen to invest in our people and in their future -- building public 
		schools, sending a generation to college on the GI Bill, laying highways 
		and railroads, building ports all across the country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rather than turn on each 
		other in times of cultural upheaval, we’ve chosen to march, to organize, 
		to sit-in, to turn out, to petition our government for women’s rights 
		and voting rights and civil rights -- even in the face of fierce 
		resistance -- because we are Americans; and no matter who we are or what 
		we look like, we believe that in this country, all are equal, all are 
		free.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rather than give in to the 
		voices suggesting we set our sights lower, downsize our dreams, or 
		settle for something less, we’ve chosen again and again to make America 
		bigger, bolder, more diverse, more generous, more hopeful.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because throughout our 
		history, what has distinguished us from all other nations is not just 
		our wealth, it’s not just our power. It’s been our deep commitment to 
		individual freedom and personal responsibility, but also our unshakeable 
		commitment to one another -- a recognition that we share a future; that 
		we rise or fall together; that we are part of a common enterprise that 
		is greater, somehow, than the sum of its parts.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, yes, class of 2011, 
		change will be a constant in your lives.&nbsp;And that can be scary.&nbsp;That can 
		be hard.&nbsp;And sometimes you’ll be tempted to turn inward; to say “What’s 
		good enough for me is good enough.”&nbsp;Sometimes you’ll be tempted to turn 
		on one another; to say “My problems are the fault of those who don’t 
		look like me or sound like me.”&nbsp; Sometime you’ll be tempted to give into 
		those voices that warn: “too hard,” “don’t try,” “no, you can’t.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But I have faith you will 
		reject those voices.&nbsp;I have faith you will reject those impulses.&nbsp;Your 
		generation was born into a world with fewer walls; a world educated in 
		an era of information, tempered by war and economic turmoil.&nbsp;And as our 
		globe has grown smaller and more connected, you’ve shed the heavy 
		weights of earlier generations.&nbsp;Your generation has grown up more 
		accepting and tolerant of people for who they are, regardless of race or 
		gender or religious belief; regardless of creed or sexual 
		orientation.&nbsp;That’s how you’ve grown up. You see our diversity as a 
		strength, not a weakness.&nbsp;And I believe those life experiences have 
		fortified you, as earlier generations were fortified, to meet the tests 
		of our time. Everything I have seen of your generation has shown me that 
		you believe, as deeply as any previous generation, that America can 
		always change for the better.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Class of 2011, you and 
		your generation are now responsible for our future.&nbsp;I’m only going to be 
		President a little bit longer. You are going to be leaders for many 
		years to come.&nbsp;You will have to make choices to keep our dream alive for 
		the next generation.&nbsp;Choices about whether we’ll stack the deck against 
		workers and the middle class, or whether we make sure America remains a 
		place where if you work hard you can get ahead.&nbsp;You’re going to have to 
		make a choice about whether we’ll say we can’t afford to educate our 
		young people and send them to college, or whether we continue to be a 
		country that makes investments that are necessary to keep those young 
		people competitive in this new century.&nbsp;It will be up to you to choose 
		whether we’ll remain vulnerable to swings in oil prices or whether we 
		invest in the clean energy that can break our dependence on oil and 
		protect our planet.&nbsp; It will be your choice as to whether we break our 
		promise to seniors and the poor and the disabled and tell them to fend 
		for themselves, or whether we keep strengthening our social safety net 
		and our health care system.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it will be up to you 
		whether we’ll turn on one another, or whether we stay true to our values 
		of fairness and opportunity, understanding that we are a nation of 
		immigrants -- immigrants that built this country into an economic 
		powerhouse and a beacon of hope around the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know this last issue 
		generates some passion.&nbsp;I know that several young people here have 
		recently identified themselves as undocumented. Some were brought here 
		as young children, and discovered the truth only as adults.&nbsp;And they’ve 
		put their futures on the line in hopes it will spur the rest of us to 
		live up to our most cherished values.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I strongly believe we 
		should fix our broken immigration system.&nbsp;Fix it so that it meets our 
		21st-century economic and security needs. And I want to work with 
		Democrats and Republicans, yes, to protect our borders, and enforce our 
		laws, and address the status of millions of undocumented workers.&nbsp;And I 
		will keep fighting alongside many of you to make the DREAM Act the law 
		of the land.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Like all of this country’s 
		movements towards justice, it will be difficult and it will take time.&nbsp; 
		I know some here wish that I could just bypass Congress and change the 
		law myself.&nbsp;But that’s not how democracy works.&nbsp; See, democracy is 
		hard.&nbsp; But it’s right.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Changing our laws means 
		doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes, one by one. 
		And I am convinced we can change the laws, because we should all be able 
		to agree that it makes no sense to expel talented young people from our 
		country.&nbsp;They grew up as Americans.&nbsp;They pledge allegiance to our flag.&nbsp; 
		And if they are trying to serve in our military or earn a degree, they 
		are contributing to our future -- and we welcome those contributions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We didn’t raise the Statue 
		of Liberty with its back to the world; we raised it with its light to 
		the world. Whether your ancestors came here on the Mayflower or a slave 
		ship; whether they signed in at Ellis Island or they crossed the Rio 
		Grande -- we are one people. We need one another.&nbsp;Our patriotism is not 
		rooted in ethnicity, but in a shared belief of the enduring and 
		permanent promise of this country.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s the promise 
		redeemed by your graduation today.&nbsp;That’s the promise that drew so many 
		of you to this college and your parents to this country. And that’s the 
		promise that drew my own father here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I didn’t know him well, my 
		father -- and he lived a troubled life.&nbsp;But I know that when he was 
		around your age, he dreamed of something more than his lot in life. He 
		dreamed of that magical place; he dreamed of coming to study in America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And when I was around your 
		age, I traveled back to his home country of Kenya for the first time to 
		learn his story.&nbsp;And I went to a tiny village called Alego, where his 
		stepmother still lives in the house where he grew up, and I visited his 
		grave.&nbsp;And I asked her if there was anything left for me to know him 
		by.&nbsp;And she opened a trunk, and she took out a stack of letters -- and 
		this is an elderly woman who doesn’t read or write -- but she had saved 
		these letters, more than 30 of them, written in his hand and addressed 
		to colleges and universities all across America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They weren’t that 
		different from the letters that I wrote when I was trying to get into 
		college, or the ones that you wrote when you were hoping to come 
		here.&nbsp;They were written in the simple, sometimes awkward, sometimes 
		grammatically incorrect, unmistakably hopeful voice of somebody who is 
		just desperate for a chance -- just desperate to live his unlikely 
		dream.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And somebody at the 
		University of Hawaii -- halfway around the world -- chose to give him 
		that chance.&nbsp;And because that person gave a young man a chance, he met a 
		young woman from Kansas; they had a son in the land where all things are 
		possible.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And one of my earliest 
		memories from growing up in Hawaii, is of sitting on my grandfather’s 
		shoulders to see the astronauts from one of the Apollo space missions 
		come ashore after a successful splashdown.&nbsp;You remember that no matter 
		how young you are as a child.&nbsp;It’s one of those unforgettable moments 
		when you first realize the miracle that is what this country is capable 
		of.&nbsp;And I remember waving a little American flag on top of my 
		grandfather’s shoulders, thinking about those astronauts, and thinking 
		about space.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And today, on this day, 
		more than 40 years later, I took my daughters to the Kennedy Space 
		Center.&nbsp;And even though we didn’t get to see the Space Shuttle Endeavour 
		launch, we met some of the astronauts, and we toured the Space Shuttle 
		Atlantis.&nbsp;And looking at my daughters, I thought of how things come full 
		circle.&nbsp; I thought of all that we’ve achieved as a nation since I was 
		their age, a little brown boy sitting on my grandfather’s shoulders -- 
		and I thought about all I want us to achieve by the time they have 
		children of their own.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s my proof that the 
		idea of America endures.&nbsp;That’s my evidence that our brave endeavor on 
		this Earth continues.&nbsp;And every single day I walk into the Oval Office, 
		and for all the days of my life, I will always remember that in no other 
		nation on Earth could my story be possible, could your stories be 
		possible.&nbsp;That is something I celebrate.&nbsp;That is something that drives 
		every decision I make.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what I ask of you, 
		graduates, as you walk out of here today is this:&nbsp;Pursue success.&nbsp;Do not 
		falter.&nbsp;When you make it, pull somebody else up.&nbsp;Preserve our 
		dream.&nbsp;Remember your life is richer when people around you have a shot 
		at opportunity as well. Strive to widen that circle of possibility; 
		strive to forge that big, generous, optimistic vision of America that we 
		inherited; strive to carry that dream forward to future generations.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you. 
		Congratulations.&nbsp; May God bless you.&nbsp;May God bless the United States of 
		America.</font></p>
