<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is wonderful to be here in the Upper Peninsula with so many 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yooper"><font color="#0000FF">Yoopers</font></a>. 
		&nbsp;How many of you are Green Bay fans, too? &nbsp;I’ve been seeing too many 
		Green Bay fans lately.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		It is great to be here. &nbsp;It is great to be at Northern Michigan 
		University. &nbsp;We’ve got some wonderful guests here that I just want to 
		mention. &nbsp;First of all, somebody who is as good a public servant, not 
		just good at what he does but good at heart and works tirelessly on 
		behalf of the entire state, your senior senator, Carl Levin, is here. 
		&nbsp;Now, his partner in the Senate could not be here because she’s actually 
		leading a Democratic caucus retreat, but she’s been fighting for 
		manufacturing, for broadband, for a lot of things that we’re talking 
		about here today. &nbsp;So I just want to acknowledge Debbie Stabenow, who 
		deeply cares about the work that you do up here.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		I want to thank the great hospitality of Mayor John Kivela, who has been 
		showing me around town. &nbsp;Thank you so much, Mayor Kivela. The President 
		of Northern Michigan University, Dr. Les Wong, is here. And all of you 
		are here. And you guys are pretty special. &nbsp;Absolutely. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Before I begin, I just want to say that we are following today’s events 
		in Egypt very closely. &nbsp;And we’ll have more to say as this plays out. 
		&nbsp;But what is absolutely clear is that we are witnessing history unfold. 
		&nbsp;It’s a moment of transformation that’s taking place because the people 
		of Egypt are calling for change. &nbsp;And they’ve turned out in 
		extraordinary numbers representing all ages and all walks of life, but 
		it’s young people who’ve been at the forefront -- a new generation, your 
		generation, who want their voices to be heard. &nbsp;And so going forward, we 
		want those young people and we want all Egyptians to know America will 
		continue to do everything that we can to support an orderly and genuine 
		transition to democracy in Egypt.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Now, as we watch what’s taking place, we’re also reminded that we live 
		in an interconnected world. &nbsp;What happens across the globe has an impact 
		on each and every one of us. &nbsp;And that’s why I’ve come to Marquette 
		today -- not only because it’s beautiful, and the people are really nice 
		-- which is true. &nbsp;But I’ve come here because in the 21st century, it’s 
		not just the big cities where change is happening. &nbsp;It’s also in towns 
		like this where the jobs and businesses of tomorrow will take root, and 
		where young and talented Americans can lead. &nbsp;It’s towns like this where 
		our economic future will be won. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Now, in the short term, the best thing we can do to speed up economic 
		growth is to make sure families and businesses have more money to spend, 
		and that’s exactly what -- got a little applause there. &nbsp;That’s exactly 
		why we passed those tax cuts in December. &nbsp;That’s what it’s doing. 
		&nbsp;Because Democrats and Republicans came together, Americans’ paychecks 
		will be a little bigger this year and businesses will be able to write 
		off their investments and companies will grow and they’ll add workers. 
		&nbsp;But we’ve got more to do. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Our measure of success has to be whether every American who wants a job 
		can find a job; whether this country is still the place where you can 
		make it if you try. &nbsp;In a world that’s more connected and more 
		competitive, other nations look at this moment as their moment, their 
		turn to win the jobs and industries of our time. &nbsp;I see things 
		differently. &nbsp;I see this as America’s moment to win the future, so that 
		the 21st century is the American century just like the 20th century was. 
		&nbsp;Yes we can.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		But to do this, we’re going to have to up our game, Marquette. &nbsp;We got 
		to up our game. &nbsp;To attract the best jobs, the newest industries, we’re 
		going to have to out-innovate, out-educate, out-build. &nbsp;We’re going to 
		have to out-hustle the rest of the world. &nbsp;That means investing in 
		cutting-edge research and technology, like the new advanced battery 
		manufacturing industry that’s taking root right here in the state of 
		Michigan. &nbsp;It means investing in the skills and training of our people, 
		just like it’s taking place at this university. &nbsp;It means investing in 
		transportation and communications networks that move goods and 
		information as fast as possible.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And to make room for these investments, we’re going to have to cut 
		whatever spending we can do without. &nbsp;We’ve got a real issue with debts 
		and deficit, and so we’ve got to live within our means. &nbsp;And that means 
		that we’ve got to cut out things that aren’t adding to growth and 
		opportunity in order to invest in those things that are.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And that’s why I’ve proposed that we freeze annual domestic spending for 
		the next five years. &nbsp;That will reduce the deficit by more than 400 
		billion dollars over the next decade. &nbsp;It will bring spending to the 
		lowest share of our economy since Eisenhower was President. &nbsp;That’s a 
		long time ago. &nbsp;Even I wasn’t born then.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So government has to do what American families do every day: live within 
		our means. &nbsp;But even as we do so, we can’t sacrifice our future. &nbsp;I’ll 
		just give you guys an analogy. &nbsp;If you’re trying to cut back in your 
		family, you might decide, we’re not going to go out to dinner so often; 
		maybe we’ll skip the vacation; we’re not going to remodel the kitchen. 
		&nbsp;But you wouldn’t stop saving for your child’s college education. &nbsp;You 
		wouldn’t stop saving for your own retirement. &nbsp;If your boiler was broken 
		or your roof had a leak, you’d still go ahead and make those 
		investments. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Well, the same is true with our country. &nbsp;We’ve got to cut out the 
		equivalence of eating out and vacations. &nbsp;I know there may be some 
		restaurant owners here -- go eat at their restaurants -- but I’m just 
		making a general point. &nbsp;Even as we cut out the things we can afford to 
		do without, we got a responsibility to invest in those areas that will 
		have the biggest impact on our future, and those things are innovation, 
		education and infrastructure. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And that last area -- infrastructure -- is why I’ve come here today. 
		&nbsp;Connecting a country of our size has never been easy. &nbsp;Just imagine 
		what Americans experienced when they fanned out from 13 colonies to 
		settle a continent. &nbsp;If you wanted to get from one coast to the other, 
		it would take you months; it would cost you a small fortune. &nbsp;If you 
		settled in the heartland, you were an island, with no real market to 
		sell your goods or buy what you needed. &nbsp;You might have to wait until 
		the traders came by before you stocked up.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So we decided to build a railroad to span a continent -- one that would 
		blast through mountains of granite and use thousands of miles of steel, 
		and put to work an army of citizens and immigrants to work. &nbsp;It was an 
		endeavor that would also require support of our government. &nbsp;It didn’t 
		just happen on its own. &nbsp;As General William T. Sherman said, “Uncle Sam 
		is the only giant I know who can grapple the subject.”<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So even as President Lincoln tried to hold the North and South together, 
		he was determined to see this railroad unite East and West. &nbsp;And private 
		companies joined the charge, racing one another to meet in the middle. 
		&nbsp;And eventually, a telephone operator -- a telegraph operator sent out a 
		simple message to the cheers of a waiting nation. &nbsp;The telegraph just 
		said: “Done.” &nbsp;Done. &nbsp;Now, if he knew that we were still talking about 
		it today, he might have come up with something more inspiring.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But overnight, the 
		transcontinental railroad laid the way for a nationwide economy, not a 
		bunch of local economies, but a nationwide economy. &nbsp;Suddenly, a 
		cross-country trip was cut from months to days. &nbsp;The cost to move goods 
		and mail plummeted. &nbsp;Cowboys drove cattle to railcars that whisked them 
		back East. &nbsp;Entrepreneurs could sell anything, anywhere. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		After the railroad was completed, a newspaper proclaimed: “We are the 
		youngest of peoples. &nbsp;But we are teaching the world to march forward.” 
		&nbsp;Teaching the world to march forward. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		That’s who we are. &nbsp;We are a nation that has always been built to 
		compete. &nbsp;And that’s why, decades later, FDR set up the Rural 
		Electrification Administration to help bring power to vast swaths of 
		America that were still in darkness. &nbsp;Companies said that building lines 
		to rural areas would be too costly. &nbsp;I mean, big cities already had 
		electricity. &nbsp;But they said, it’s too costly to go out into remote 
		areas. &nbsp;It’s too costly to come up into the Upper Peninsula. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So Americans in these towns went without refrigeration or running water. 
		&nbsp;If you wanted a glimpse of the larger world, your town might run a 
		movie off a small diesel engine. &nbsp;It might not even last the full film. 
		&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Once power lines were laid down, electricity flowed to farms across the 
		country, transforming millions of lives. &nbsp;There’s a well-known story of 
		a Texas family returning home the first night their farmhouse was hooked 
		up, and a woman thought it was on fire. &nbsp;And her daughter said, “No, 
		Mama, the lights are on.” &nbsp;Think about that. &nbsp;That wasn’t that long ago, 
		and government was there to help make sure that everybody -- everybody, 
		not just some -- but everybody -- not just those who folks could make an 
		immediate profit off of -- but everybody had access to electricity.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So years later, as our nation grew by leaps and bounds, we realized that 
		a patchwork system of back roads and dirt paths couldn’t handle the 
		biggest economy in the world. &nbsp;So President Eisenhower helped make it 
		possible to build an Interstate Highway System, and that, too, 
		transformed the nation -- as much as the railways had.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And finally, we could ship goods and services to places that the 
		railroads didn’t reach. &nbsp;It meant that we could live apart from where we 
		worked. &nbsp;We could travel. &nbsp;We could see America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Each of these achievements 
		-- none of them just happened. &nbsp;We chose to do them. &nbsp;We chose to do big 
		things. &nbsp;And every American benefited -- not just from new conveniences. 
		&nbsp;Not just from the jobs created by laying down new lines or tracks or 
		pavement. &nbsp;We benefited enormously from new economic growth -- from the 
		scores of businesses that opened near each town’s new train station, or 
		new power line, or new off-ramp.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So this is a new century, and we can’t expect tomorrow’s economy to take 
		root using yesterday’s infrastructure. &nbsp;We got to think about what’s the 
		next thing, what’s the next big thing, and make sure that we’re at the 
		forefront -- just like we were in the last century.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Today, new companies are going to seek out the fastest, most reliable 
		ways to move people, goods and information, whether they are in Shanghai 
		or in Chicago. &nbsp;So if we want new jobs and businesses here in America, 
		we’ve got to have the best transportation system and the best 
		communication network in the world. &nbsp;It’s like that movie, Field of 
		Dreams: &nbsp;<a href="../../MovieSpeeches/moviespeechfieldofdreams.html"><font color="#0000FF">If 
		we build it, they will come</font></a>. &nbsp;But we’ve got to build it. 
		&nbsp;We’ve got to build it.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Over the last two years, we’ve begun rebuilding for the 21st century. 
		&nbsp;This is a national project that has meant thousands of jobs for the 
		hard-hit construction industry. &nbsp;And I’ve now proposed redoubling these 
		efforts. &nbsp;We want to put more Americans to work repairing crumbling 
		bridges and roads. &nbsp;Within 25 years, our goal is to have 80 percent of 
		Americans with access to high-speed rail, which could allow you to go to 
		places in half the time it takes by car. &nbsp;Within five years, we want to 
		make it possible for businesses to put high-speed wireless services in 
		reach of virtually every American.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And that last part, high-speed wireless, is why I chose to come to 
		Northern Michigan University today. Now let me give you some context. 
		&nbsp;Today, more than 90 percent of homes in South Korea subscribe to 
		high-speed broadband. &nbsp;They just have better networks than we do. &nbsp;In 
		America, the nation that created the Internet -- by the way, because of 
		government investment; it didn’t just happen by itself magically -- 
		because of government R&amp;D, we created the Internet, but yet only 65 
		percent of households here in America can say the same. &nbsp;When it comes 
		to high-speed Internet, the lights are still off in one-third of our 
		households. &nbsp;One out of every three households in America don’t have 
		that same access. &nbsp;For millions of Americans, the railway hasn’t showed 
		up yet.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		For our families and our businesses, high-speed wireless service, that’s 
		the next train station; it’s the next off-ramp. &nbsp;It’s how we’ll spark 
		new innovation, new investment, new jobs. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And you know this here in Northern Michigan. &nbsp;That’s why I showed up, in 
		addition to it being pretty and people being nice. &nbsp;For decades now, 
		this university has given a new laptop to every incoming student. &nbsp;Wi-Fi 
		stretched across campus. &nbsp;But if you lived off-campus, like most 
		students and teachers here, you were largely out of luck. &nbsp;Broadband was 
		often too expensive to afford. &nbsp;And if you lived a bit further out of 
		town, you were completely out of luck, because broadband providers, they 
		often won’t build networks where it’s not profitable, just like they 
		wouldn’t build electrical lines where it wasn’t profitable.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So this university tried something new. &nbsp;You partnered with various 
		companies to build a high-speed, next-generation wireless network. &nbsp;And 
		you managed to install it with six people in only four days without 
		raising tuition. &nbsp;Good job. &nbsp;Good job, Mr. President. &nbsp;By the way, if 
		you give me the name of these six people -- there’s a whole bunch of 
		stuff in Washington I’d like to see done in four days with six people.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So today, this is one of America’s most connected universities, and 
		enrollment is near the highest it’s been in 30 years.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And what’s more -- and this is what makes this special -- you told 
		nearby towns that if they allowed you to retrofit their towers with new 
		equipment to expand your network, then their schools, their first 
		responders, their city governments could use it too. &nbsp;And as a result, 
		police officers can access crime databases in their cars. &nbsp;And 
		firefighters can download blueprints on the way to a burning building. 
		&nbsp;And public works officials can save money by monitoring pumps and 
		equipment remotely. &nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And you’ve created new online learning opportunities for K-12 students 
		as far as 30 miles away, some of whom -- some of whom can’t always make 
		it to school in a place that averages 200 inches of snow a year. Now, 
		some of these students don’t appreciate the end of school [snow] days. 
		&nbsp;I know Malia and Sasha get really excited about school [snow] days. &nbsp;Of 
		course, in Washington things shut down when there’s an inch of snow. But 
		this technology is giving them more opportunity. &nbsp;It’s good for their 
		education, it’s good for our economy. &nbsp;In fact, I just came from a 
		demonstration of online learning in action. &nbsp;We were with Professor 
		Lubig and he had plugged in Negaunee High School -- and Powell Township 
		School in Big Bay. &nbsp;So I felt like the guy in Star Trek. &nbsp;I was being 
		beamed around -- across the Upper Peninsula here. &nbsp;But it was remarkable 
		to see the possibilities for these young people who are able to, let’s 
		say, do a chemistry experiment, and they can compare the results with 
		kids in Boston.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Or if there’s some learning tool or material they don’t have immediately 
		accessible in their school, they can connect here to the university, and 
		they’re able to tap into it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s opening up an entire 
		world to them. &nbsp;And one of the young people who I was talking to, he 
		talked about foreign policy and what we were seeing in places like 
		Egyptian. &nbsp;And he said, what’s amazing especially for us is that now we 
		have a window to the entire world, and we can start understanding other 
		cultures and other places in ways that we could never do without this 
		technology.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		For local businesses, broadband access is helping them grow and prosper 
		and compete in a global economy. &nbsp;In fact, Marquette has been rated one 
		of the top five “eCities” in Michigan for entrepreneurship. &nbsp;That’s 
		right.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So here’s a great example, Getz’s Clothiers. The Getzes are here. &nbsp;Where 
		are the Getzes? &nbsp;They’re around here somewhere. &nbsp;There they are right 
		there.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a third-generation, 
		family-owned, Marquette institution. &nbsp;They’ve occupied the same downtown 
		store for more than a century -- but with the help of broadband, they 
		were recently listed as one of America’s 5,000 fastest-growing 
		companies. &nbsp;Now how did they pull that off?<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Obviously they’ve got great products, great service. &nbsp;But what’s also 
		true is online sales now make up more than two-thirds of their annual 
		revenue. &nbsp;Think about that. &nbsp;You got a downtown department store; now 
		two-thirds of its sales are online. &nbsp;It can process more than 1,000 
		orders a day, and its workforce has more than doubled. &nbsp;So you’ve got a 
		local business with a global footprint because of technology.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Now, if you can do this in snowy U.P. -- we can do it all across 
		America. &nbsp;In fact, many places already are. &nbsp;So in Wagner, South Dakota, 
		patients can receive high-quality, lifesaving medical care from a Sioux 
		Falls specialist who can monitor their EKG and listen to their breathing 
		-- from 100 miles away. &nbsp;In
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Sleep,_Wyoming">
		<font color="#0000FF">Ten Sleep, Wyoming</font></a> -- I love the name 
		of that town, Ten Sleep -- it’s a town in Wyoming of 300 people. &nbsp;A 
		fiber-optic network allowed a company to employ several hundred teachers 
		who teach English to students in Asia over the Internet, 24 hours a day. 
		&nbsp;You’ve all heard about outsourcing. &nbsp;Well, this is “insourcing” -- 
		where overseas work is done right here in the United States of America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we want to multiply these 
		stories -- we want to multiply your story -- all over the country. &nbsp;We 
		want to invest in the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage 
		for 98 percent of Americans.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		This isn’t just about faster Internet or being able to find a friend on 
		Facebook. &nbsp;It’s about connecting every corner of America to the digital 
		age. &nbsp;It’s about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers can 
		monitor weather across the state and market across the globe. &nbsp;It’s 
		about an entrepreneur on Main Street with a great idea she hopes to sell 
		to the big city. &nbsp;It’s about every young person who no longer has to 
		leave his hometown to seek new opportunity -- because opportunity is 
		right there at his or her fingertips.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So to make this happen, 
		we’re going to invest in research and development of emerging 
		technologies and applications. &nbsp;We’re going to accelerate breakthroughs 
		in health and education and transportation, and deploy a new nationwide, 
		interoperable wireless network for first responders -- making sure 
		they’ve got the funding and the frequencies that they were promised and 
		that they need to keep us safe. &nbsp;It’s important. &nbsp;By selling private 
		companies the rights to these airwaves, we won’t just encourage private 
		investment and expand wireless access; we’re actually going to bring in 
		revenues that lower our deficits.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, access to high-speed 
		Internet by itself won’t make a business more successful, or a student 
		smarter, or a citizen more informed. &nbsp;That takes hard work. &nbsp;It takes 
		those late nights. &nbsp;It takes hustle. &nbsp;It takes that quintessentially 
		American drive to be the best. &nbsp;That’s what’s the most important 
		ingredient for our success.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		But we’ve always believed that we have a responsibility to guarantee all 
		our people every tool necessary for them to meet their full potential. 
		&nbsp;So if they’re willing to work hard, they can succeed. &nbsp;And in a 
		21st-century economy, that has never been more important. &nbsp;Every 
		American deserves access to the world’s information. &nbsp;Every American 
		deserves access to the global economy. &nbsp;We have promised this for 15 
		years. &nbsp;It’s time we delivered on that promise. It’s time we delivered 
		on that promise.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		So connecting our people. &nbsp;Competing with the rest of the world. &nbsp;Living 
		within our means without sacrificing what’s required to win the future. 
		&nbsp;We can do all this because we’ve done it before.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		In 1960, at the height of his presidential campaign, JFK came to 
		Michigan. &nbsp;And it was a moment similar to this one. Other nations were 
		doing their best to try to take our place at the top. &nbsp;And here in 
		Michigan, he made it clear that if we wanted to keep from being knocked 
		off our perch, there could only be one goal for the United States. &nbsp;It 
		could be summed up in one word: “first.” &nbsp;First.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">“I do not mean first, but,” 
		he said. &nbsp;“I don’t mean first, when. &nbsp;I don’t mean first, if. &nbsp;I mean 
		first -- period.” &nbsp;And “The real question now,” he continued, “The real 
		question,” he continued, “is whether we’re up to the task -- whether 
		each and every one of us is willing to face the facts, to bear the 
		burdens, to provide the risks, and to meet our dangers.” &nbsp;That was 50 
		years ago. &nbsp;But things haven’t changed in terms of what’s required to 
		succeed.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And we were up to the task then. &nbsp;I believe we’re up to the task today. 
		&nbsp;Time and again, whether westward or skyward, with each rail and road 
		that we’ve laid, in every community, we’ve connected with our own 
		science and imagination, and we forged anew our faith that we can do 
		anything. &nbsp;We do big things. &nbsp;That’s who we are. &nbsp;And that’s who we’re 
		going to have to be again -- a young nation that teaches the world to 
		march forward.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		That’s what you’re doing up here in U.P. &nbsp;That’s what you’re doing here 
		at Northern Michigan University. &nbsp;That’s what we’re all going to do 
		together in the months and years to come.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Thank you. &nbsp;God bless you. &nbsp;God bless the United States of America.</font></p>
