<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Prime Minister Gillard, 
		Leader Abbott, thank you both for your very warm welcome.&nbsp; Mr. Speaker, 
		Mr. President, members of the House and Senate, ladies and gentlemen, I 
		thank you for the honor of standing in this great chamber to reaffirm 
		the bonds between the United States and the Commonwealth of Australia, 
		two of the world’s oldest democracies and two of the world's oldest 
		friends.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To you and the people of 
		Australia, thank you for your extraordinary hospitality.&nbsp; And here, in 
		this city -- this ancient “meeting place” -- I want to acknowledge the 
		original inhabitants of this land, and one of the world’s oldest 
		continuous cultures, 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians">
		<font color="#0000FF">the First Australians</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I first came to Australia as 
		a child, traveling between my birthplace of Hawaii, and Indonesia, where 
		I would live for four years.&nbsp; As an eight-year-old, I couldn’t always 
		understand your foreign language.&nbsp;Last night I did try to talk some &quot;Strine.&quot;&nbsp; 
		Today I don’t want to subject you to any earbashing.&nbsp; I really do love 
		that one and I will be introducing that into the vernacular in 
		Washington.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But to a young American boy, 
		Australia and its people -- your optimism, your easy-going ways, your 
		irreverent sense of humor -- all felt so familiar.&nbsp; It felt like home.&nbsp; 
		I’ve always wanted to return.&nbsp; I tried last year -- twice.&nbsp; But this is 
		a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">
		<font color="#0000FF">Lucky Country</font></a>, and today I feel lucky to be here as we mark the 60th 
		anniversary of our unbreakable alliance.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The bonds between us run 
		deep.&nbsp; In each other’s story we see so much of ourselves.&nbsp; Ancestors who 
		crossed vast oceans -- some by choice, some in chains.&nbsp; Settlers who 
		pushed west across sweeping plains.&nbsp; Dreamers who toiled with hearts and 
		hands to lay railroads and to build cities.&nbsp; Generations of immigrants 
		who, with each new arrival, add a new thread to the brilliant tapestry 
		of our nations.&nbsp; And we are citizens who live by a common creed -- no 
		matter who you are, no matter what you look like, everyone deserves a 
		fair chance; everyone deserves a fair go.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course, progress in our 
		society has not always come without tensions, or struggles to overcome a 
		painful past.&nbsp; But we are countries with a willingness to face our 
		imperfections, and to keep reaching for our ideals.&nbsp; That’s the spirit 
		we saw in this chamber three years ago, as this nation inspired the 
		world with a historic gesture of reconciliation with Indigenous 
		Australians.&nbsp; It’s the spirit of progress, in America, which allows me 
		to stand before you today, as President of the United States.&nbsp; And it’s 
		the spirit I’ll see later today when I become the first U.S. President 
		to visit the Northern Territory, where I’ll meet the Traditional Owners 
		of the Land.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nor has our progress come 
		without great sacrifice.&nbsp; This morning, I was humbled and deeply moved 
		by a visit to your war memorial to pay my respects to Australia’s fallen 
		sons and daughters.&nbsp; Later today, in Darwin, I’ll join the Prime 
		Minister in saluting our brave men and women in uniform.&nbsp; And it will be 
		a reminder that -- from the trenches of the First World War to the 
		mountains of Afghanistan -- Aussies and Americans have stood together, 
		we have fought together, we have given lives together in every single 
		major conflict of the past hundred years.&nbsp; Every single one.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This solidarity has 
		sustained us through a difficult decade. We will never forget the 
		attacks of 9/11, that took the lives not only of Americans, but people 
		from many nations, including Australia.&nbsp; In the United States, we will 
		never forget how Australia invoked the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS_Treaty">
		<font color="#0000FF">ANZUS Treaty</font></a> -- for the first 
		time ever -- showing that our two nations stood as one.&nbsp; And none of us 
		will ever forget those we’ve lost to al Qaeda’s terror in the years 
		since, including innocent Australians.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that’s why, as both the 
		Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader indicated, we are determined to 
		succeed in Afghanistan.&nbsp; It is why I salute Australia -- outside of 
		NATO, the largest contributor of troops to this vital mission.&nbsp; And it’s 
		why we honor all those who have served there for our security, including 
		32 Australian patriots who gave their lives, among them Captain Bryce 
		Duffy, Corporal Ashley Birt, and Lance Corporal Luke Gavin.&nbsp; We will 
		honor their sacrifice by making sure that Afghanistan is never again 
		used as a source for attacks against our people.&nbsp; Never again.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As two global partners, we 
		stand up for the security and the dignity of people around the world.&nbsp; 
		We see it when our rescue workers rush to help others in times of fire 
		and drought and flooding rains.&nbsp; We see it when we partner to keep the 
		peace -- from East Timor to the Balkans -- and when we pursue our shared 
		vision:&nbsp; a world without nuclear weapons.&nbsp; We see it in the development 
		that lifts up a child in Africa; the assistance that saves a family from 
		famine; and when we extend our support to the people of the Middle East 
		and North Africa, who deserve the same liberty that allows us to gather 
		in this great hall of democracy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the alliance we 
		reaffirm today -- rooted in our values; renewed by every generation.&nbsp; 
		This is the partnership we worked to deepen over the past three years.&nbsp; 
		And today I can stand before you and say with confidence that the 
		alliance between the United States and Australia has never been 
		stronger. It has been to our past; our alliance continues to be 
		indispensable to our future.&nbsp; So here, among close friends, I’d like to 
		address the larger purpose of my visit to this region -- our efforts to 
		advance security, prosperity and human dignity across the Asia Pacific.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the United States, this 
		reflects a broader shift.&nbsp; After a decade in which we fought two wars 
		that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning 
		our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region.&nbsp; In just 
		a few weeks, after nearly nine years, the last American troops will 
		leave Iraq and our war there will be over.&nbsp; In Afghanistan, we’ve begun 
		a transition -- a responsible transition -- so Afghans can take 
		responsibility for their future and so coalition forces can begin to 
		draw down.&nbsp; And with partners like Australia, we’ve struck major blows 
		against al Qaeda and put that terrorist organization on the path to 
		defeat, including <a href="barackobamaosamabinladendeath.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">delivering justice to Osama bin Laden</font></a>.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So make no mistake, the tide 
		of war is receding, and America is looking ahead to the future that we 
		must build.&nbsp; From Europe to the Americas, we've strengthened alliances 
		and partnerships.&nbsp; At home, we’re investing in the sources of our 
		long-term economic strength -- the education of our children, the 
		training of our workers, the infrastructure that fuels commerce, the 
		science and the research that leads to new breakthroughs.&nbsp; We’ve made 
		hard decisions to cut our deficit and put our fiscal house in order -- 
		and we will continue to do more.&nbsp; Because our economic strength at home 
		is the foundation of our leadership in the world, including here in the 
		Asia Pacific.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our new focus on this region 
		reflects a fundamental truth -- the United States has been, and always 
		will be, a Pacific nation. Asian immigrants helped build America, and 
		millions of American families, including my own, cherish our ties to 
		this region.&nbsp; From the 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Darwin">
		<font color="#0000FF">bombing of Darwin</font></a> to the liberation of Pacific 
		islands, from the rice paddies of Southeast Asia to a cold Korean 
		Peninsula, generations of Americans have served here, and died here -- 
		so democracies could take root; so economic miracles could lift hundreds 
		of millions to prosperity.&nbsp; Americans have bled with you for this 
		progress, and we will not allow it -- we will never allow it to be 
		reversed.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here, we see the future.&nbsp; As 
		the world’s fastest-growing region -- and home to more than half the 
		global economy -- the Asia Pacific is critical to achieving my highest 
		priority, and that's creating jobs and opportunity for the American 
		people.&nbsp; With most of the world’s nuclear power and some half of 
		humanity, Asia will largely define whether the century ahead will be 
		marked by conflict or cooperation, needless suffering or human 
		progress.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As President, I have, 
		therefore, made a deliberate and strategic decision -- as a Pacific 
		nation, the United States will play a larger and long-term role in 
		shaping this region and its future, by upholding core principles and in 
		close partnership with our allies and friends.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let me tell you what this 
		means.&nbsp; First, we seek security, which is the foundation of peace and 
		prosperity.&nbsp; We stand for an international order in which the rights and 
		responsibilities of all nations and all people are upheld.&nbsp; Where 
		international law and norms are enforced.&nbsp; Where commerce and freedom of 
		navigation are not impeded.&nbsp; Where emerging powers contribute to 
		regional security, and where disagreements are resolved peacefully.&nbsp; 
		That's the future that we seek.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, I know that some in 
		this region have wondered about America’s commitment to upholding these 
		principles.&nbsp; So let me address this directly.&nbsp; As the United States puts 
		our fiscal house in order, we are reducing our spending.&nbsp; And, yes, 
		after a decade of extraordinary growth in our military budgets -- and as 
		we definitively end the war in Iraq, and begin to wind down the war in 
		Afghanistan -- we will make some reductions in defense spending.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As we consider the future of 
		our armed forces, we've begun a review that will identify our most 
		important strategic interests and guide our defense priorities and 
		spending over the coming decade.&nbsp; So here is what this region must 
		know.&nbsp; As we end today’s wars, I have directed my national security team 
		to make our presence and mission in the Asia Pacific a top priority.&nbsp; As 
		a result, reductions in U.S. defense spending will not -- I repeat, will 
		not -- come at the expense of the Asia Pacific.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">My guidance is clear.&nbsp; As we 
		plan and budget for the future, we will allocate the resources necessary 
		to maintain our strong military presence in this region.&nbsp; We will 
		preserve our unique ability to project power and deter threats to 
		peace.&nbsp; We will keep our commitments, including our treaty obligations 
		to allies like Australia.&nbsp; And we will constantly strengthen our 
		capabilities to meet the needs of the 21st century.&nbsp; Our enduring 
		interests in the region demand our enduring presence in the region.&nbsp; The 
		United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, we are already 
		modernizing America’s defense posture across the Asia Pacific.&nbsp; It will 
		be more broadly distributed -- maintaining our strong presence in Japan 
		and the Korean Peninsula, while enhancing our presence in Southeast 
		Asia.&nbsp; Our posture will be more flexible -- with new capabilities to 
		ensure that our forces can operate freely.&nbsp; And our posture will be more 
		sustainable, by helping allies and partners build their capacity, with 
		more training and exercises.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We see our new posture here 
		in Australia.&nbsp; The 
		<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/16/remarks-president-obama-and-prime-minister-gillard-australia-joint-press">
		<font color="#0000FF">initiatives that the Prime Minister and I announced 
		yesterday</font></a> will bring our two militaries even closer together.&nbsp; We’ll 
		have new opportunities to train with other allies and partners, from the 
		Pacific to the Indian Ocean.&nbsp; And it will allow us to respond faster to 
		the full range of challenges, including humanitarian crises and disaster 
		relief.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since World War II, 
		Australians have warmly welcomed American service members who've passed 
		through.&nbsp; On behalf of the American people, I thank you for welcoming 
		those who will come next, as they ensure that our alliance stays strong 
		and ready for the tests of our time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We see America’s enhanced 
		presence in the alliance that we’ve strengthened:&nbsp; In Japan, where our 
		alliance remains a cornerstone of regional security.&nbsp; In Thailand, where 
		we’re partnering for disaster relief.&nbsp; In the Philippines, where we’re 
		increasing ship visits and training.&nbsp; And in South Korea, where our 
		commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea will never waver.&nbsp; 
		Indeed, we also reiterate our resolve to act firmly against any 
		proliferation activities by North Korea.&nbsp; The transfer of nuclear 
		materials or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities 
		would be considered a grave threat to the United States and our allies, 
		and we would hold North Korea fully accountable for the consequences of 
		such action.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We see America’s enhanced 
		presence across Southeast Asia -- in our partnership with Indonesia 
		against piracy and violent extremism, and in our work with Malaysia to 
		prevent proliferation; in the ships we’ll deploy to Singapore, and in 
		our closer cooperation with Vietnam and Cambodia; and in our welcome of 
		India as it “looks east” and plays a larger role as an Asian power.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the same time, we’ll 
		reengage with our regional organizations.&nbsp; Our work in Bali this week 
		will mark my third meeting with ASEAN leaders, and I’ll be proud to be 
		the first American President to attend the East Asia Summit.&nbsp; And 
		together, I believe we can address shared challenges, such as 
		proliferation and maritime security, including cooperation in the South 
		China Sea.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, the United States 
		will continue our effort to build a cooperative relationship with 
		China.&nbsp; All of our nations -- Australia, the United States -- all of our 
		nations have a profound interest in the rise of a peaceful and 
		prosperous China. That's why the United States welcomes it.&nbsp; We’ve seen 
		that China can be a partner from reducing tensions on the Korean 
		Peninsula to preventing proliferation.&nbsp; And we’ll seek more 
		opportunities for cooperation with Beijing, including greater 
		communication between our militaries to promote understanding and avoid 
		miscalculation.&nbsp; We will do this, even as we continue to speak candidly 
		to Beijing about the importance of upholding international norms and 
		respecting the universal human rights of the Chinese people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A secure and peaceful Asia 
		is the foundation for the second area in which America is leading again, 
		and that's advancing our shared prosperity.&nbsp; History teaches us the 
		greatest force the world has ever known for creating wealth and 
		opportunity is free markets.&nbsp; So we seek economies that are open and 
		transparent.&nbsp; We seek trade that is free and fair.&nbsp; And we seek an open 
		international economic system, where rules are clear and every nation 
		plays by them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Australia and America, we 
		understand these principles.&nbsp; We’re among the most open economies on 
		Earth.&nbsp; Six years into our landmark trade agreement, commerce between us 
		has soared.&nbsp; Our workers are creating new partnerships and new products, 
		like the advanced aircraft technologies we build together in Victoria.&nbsp; 
		We’re the leading investor in Australia, and you invest more in America 
		than you do in any other nation, creating good jobs in both countries.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We recognize that economic 
		partnerships can’t just be about one nation extracting another’s 
		resources.&nbsp; We understand that no long-term strategy for growth can be 
		imposed from above.&nbsp; Real prosperity -- prosperity that fosters 
		innovation, and prosperity that endures -- comes from unleashing our 
		greatest economic resource, and that’s the entrepreneurial spirit, the 
		talents of our people.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So even as America competes 
		aggressively in Asian markets, we’re forging the economic partnerships 
		that create opportunity for all.&nbsp; Building on our historic trade 
		agreement with South Korea, we’re working with Australia and our other 
		APEC partners to create a seamless regional economy.&nbsp; And with Australia 
		and other partners, we’re on track to achieve our most ambitious trade 
		agreement yet, and a potential model for the entire region -- the 
		Trans-Pacific Partnership.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The United States remains 
		the world’s largest and most dynamic economy.&nbsp; But in an interconnected 
		world, we all rise and fall together.&nbsp; That’s why I pushed so hard to 
		put the G20 at the front and center of global economic decision-making 
		-- to give more nations a leadership role in managing the international 
		economy, including Australia.&nbsp; And together, we saved the world economy 
		from a depression.&nbsp; And now, our urgent challenge is to create the 
		growth that puts people to work.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We need growth that is fair, 
		where every nation plays by the rules; where workers rights are 
		respected, and our businesses can compete on a level playing field; 
		where the intellectual property and new technologies that fuel 
		innovation are protected; and where currencies are market driven so no 
		nation has an unfair advantage.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We also need growth that is 
		broad -- not just for the few, but for the many -- with reforms that 
		protect consumers from abuse and a global commitment to end the 
		corruption that stifles growth.&nbsp; We need growth that is balanced, 
		because we will all prosper more when countries with large surpluses 
		take action to boost demand at home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And we need growth that is 
		sustainable.&nbsp; This includes the clean energy that creates green jobs and 
		combats climate change, which cannot be denied.&nbsp; We see it in the 
		stronger fires, the devastating floods, the Pacific islands confronting 
		rising seas. And as countries with large carbon footprints, the United 
		States and Australia have a special responsibility to lead.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Every nation will contribute 
		to the solution in its own way -- and I know this issue is not without 
		controversy, in both our countries.&nbsp; But what we can do -- and what we 
		are doing -- is to work together to make unprecedented investments in 
		clean energy, to increase energy efficiency, and to meet the commitments 
		we made at Copenhagen and Cancun.&nbsp; We can do this, and we will.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As we grow our economies, 
		we’ll also remember the link between growth and good governance -- the 
		rule of law, transparent institutions, the equal administration of 
		justice.&nbsp; Because history shows that, over the long run, democracy and 
		economic growth go hand in hand.&nbsp; And prosperity without freedom is just 
		another form of poverty.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And this brings me to the 
		final area where we are leading -- our support for the fundamental 
		rights of every human being.&nbsp; Every nation will chart its own course.&nbsp; 
		Yet it is also true that certain rights are universal; among them, 
		freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of 
		religion, and the freedom of citizens to choose their own leaders.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These are not American 
		rights, or Australian rights, or Western rights.&nbsp; These are human 
		rights.&nbsp; They stir in every soul, as we’ve seen in the democracies that 
		have succeeded here in Asia.&nbsp; Other models have been tried and they have 
		failed -- fascism and communism, rule by one man and rule by committee.&nbsp; 
		And they failed for the same simple reason:&nbsp; They ignore the ultimate 
		source of power and legitimacy -- the will of the people.&nbsp; Yes, 
		democracy can be messy and rough -- I understand you mix it up quite 
		well during Question Time.&nbsp; But whatever our differences of party or of 
		ideology, we know in our democracies we are blessed with the greatest 
		form of government ever known to man.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So as two great democracies, 
		we speak up for those freedoms when they are threatened.&nbsp; We partner 
		with emerging democracies, like Indonesia, to help strengthen the 
		institutions upon which good governance depends.&nbsp; We encourage open 
		government, because democracies depend on an informed and active 
		citizenry.&nbsp; We help strengthen civil societies, because they empower our 
		citizens to hold their governments accountable.&nbsp; And we advance the 
		rights of all people -- women, minorities and indigenous cultures -- 
		because when societies harness the potential of all their citizens, 
		these societies are more successful, they are more prosperous and they 
		are more just.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These principles have guided 
		our approach to Burma, with a combination of sanctions and engagement.&nbsp; 
		And today, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi">
		<font color="#0000FF">Aung San Suu Kyi</font></a> is free from house arrest.&nbsp; Some political 
		prisoners have been released, and the government has begun a dialogue.&nbsp; 
		Still, violations of human rights persist.&nbsp; So we will continue to speak 
		clearly about the steps that must be taken for the government of Burma 
		to have a better relationship with the United States.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the future we seek 
		in the Asia Pacific -- security, prosperity and dignity for all.&nbsp; That’s 
		what we stand for.&nbsp; That’s who we are.&nbsp; That’s the future we will 
		pursue, in partnership with allies and friends, and with every element 
		of American power.&nbsp; So let there be no doubt:&nbsp; In the Asia Pacific in 
		the 21st century, the United States of America is all in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, in times of great 
		change and uncertainty, the future can seem unsettling.&nbsp; Across a vast 
		ocean, it’s impossible to know what lies beyond the horizon.&nbsp; But if 
		this vast region and its people teach us anything, it’s the yearning for 
		liberty and progress will not be denied.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s why women in this 
		country demanded that their voices be heard, making Australia the first 
		nation to let women vote and run for parliament and, one day, become 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard#Prime_Minister">
		<font color="#0000FF">Prime Minister</font></a>.&nbsp; It’s why the people took to the streets -- from Delhi 
		to Seoul, from Manila to Jakarta -- to throw off colonialism and 
		dictatorship and build some of the world’s largest democracies.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s why a soldier in a 
		watchtower along the DMZ defends a free people in the South, and why a 
		man from the North risks his life to escape across the border.&nbsp; Why 
		soldiers in blue helmets keep the peace in a new nation.&nbsp; And why women 
		of courage go into brothels to save young girls from modern-day slavery, 
		which must come to an end.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s why men of peace in 
		saffron robes faced beatings and bullets, and why every day -- from some 
		of the world’s largest cities to dusty rural towns, in small acts of 
		courage the world may never see -- a student posts a blog; a citizen 
		signs a charter; an activist remains unbowed, imprisoned in his home, 
		just to have the same rights that we cherish here today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Men and women like these 
		know what the world must never forget.&nbsp; The currents of history may ebb 
		and flow, but over time they move -- decidedly, decisively -- in a 
		single direction.&nbsp; History is on the side of the free -- free societies, 
		free governments, free economies, free people.&nbsp; And the future belongs 
		to those who stand firm for those ideals, in this region and around the 
		world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the story of the 
		alliance we celebrate today.&nbsp; This is the essence of America’s 
		leadership; it is the essence of our partnership.&nbsp; This is the work we 
		will carry on together, for the security and prosperity and dignity of 
		all people.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So God bless Australia.&nbsp; God 
		bless America.&nbsp; And God bless the friendship between our two peoples.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you very much.</font></p>
