		it was a slow day, so I’ve --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp; Slow news day, huh?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font color="#000048" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>President Obama:</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp; -- bring 
		the other guy in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Obviously, there’s a big 
		debate going on about taxes, and about the need to grow the economy and 
		to create jobs.&nbsp; And just about every day this week, I’ve been making an 
		argument as to why the agreement that we’ve struck to provide billions 
		of dollars in payroll tax cuts that can immediately help rejuvenate the 
		economy, as well as tax cuts for middle-class families, unemployment 
		insurance for folks who desperately need it, credits for college, Child 
		Tax Credits, as well as a range of business investments credits are so 
		important to make sure that we keep this recovery moving.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I just had a terrific 
		meeting with the former President, President Bill Clinton.&nbsp; And we just 
		happened to have this as a topic of conversation.&nbsp; And I thought, given 
		the fact that he presided over as good an economy as we’ve seen in our 
		lifetimes, that it might be useful for him to share some of his 
		thoughts.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’m going to let him speak 
		very briefly.&nbsp; And then I’ve actually got to go over and do some -- just 
		one more Christmas party.&nbsp; So he may decide he wants to take some 
		questions, but I want to make sure that you guys hear it from him 
		directly.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/barackobamawjclinton2.jpg" width="252" height="171">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		Thank you very much, Mr. President.&nbsp; First of all, I feel awkward being 
		here, and now you’re going to leave me all by myself. Let me just say a 
		couple of things.&nbsp; First of all, I still spend about an hour a day 
		trying to study this economy.&nbsp; And I’m not running for anything, and I 
		don’t have a political agenda.&nbsp; I just -- I try to figure out what to 
		do.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have reviewed this 
		agreement that the President reached with Republican leaders.&nbsp; And I 
		want to make full disclosure I make quite a bit of money now, so the 
		position that the Republicans have urged will personally benefit me.&nbsp; 
		And on its own, I wouldn’t support it because I don’t think that my tax 
		cut is the most economically efficient way to get the economy going 
		again.&nbsp; But I don’t want to be in the dark about the fact that I will 
		receive the continuation of the tax rates.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, the agreement taken 
		as a whole is, I believe, the best bipartisan agreement we can reach to 
		help the largest number of Americans, and to maximize the chances that 
		the economic recovery will accelerate and create more jobs, and to 
		minimize the chances that it will slip back, which is what has happened 
		in other financial collapses.&nbsp; Like, that’s what Japan faced, and it’s 
		something that we have to avoid in America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Why do I say that?&nbsp; First of 
		all, because clearly the extension of unemployment, which gives people a 
		percentage of the income they were previously making, will -- that money 
		will be spent and it will bolster the economy for the next couple of 
		years.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Secondly, the conversion of 
		the Make Work Pay Tax Credit, which the President passed before, which 
		goes to -- went to 95 percent of the American people, converting that 
		into an $120 billion one-year payroll tax relief act is, according to 
		all the economic analyses, the single most effective tax cut you can do 
		to support economic activity.&nbsp; This will actually create a fair number 
		of jobs.&nbsp; I expect it to lower the unemployment rate and keep us going.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thirdly, and one thing I 
		haven’t seen much about in the reports, this agreement will really help 
		America over the long term, because it continues the credits for 
		manufacturing jobs related to energy coming in to America.&nbsp; And I’ll 
		remind you, just in the last two years, there have been 30 high-powered 
		battery factories either opened or presently being built in America, 
		taking us from 2 to 20 percent of the world’s share of that.&nbsp; And we’re 
		going to probably be at 40 percent by 2014.&nbsp; This is a really important 
		thing, bringing manufacturing back to America, because it’s a huge 
		multiplier to create new jobs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So in my opinion, this is a 
		good bill.&nbsp; And I hope that my fellow Democrats will support it.&nbsp; I 
		thank the Republican leaders for agreeing to include things that were 
		important to the President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is never a perfect 
		bipartisan bill in the eyes of a partisan.&nbsp; And we all see this 
		differently.&nbsp; But I really believe this will be a significant net-plus 
		for the country.&nbsp; I also think that in general a lot of people are 
		heaving a sigh of relief that there’s finally been some agreement on 
		something.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But don't minimize the 
		impact of the unemployment relief for working families, of the payroll 
		tax relief, and of the continuation of the incentives to grow jobs, 
		which will trigger more credit coming out of the banks.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Keep in mind, ultimately the 
		long-term answer here is to get the $2 trillion, which banks now have in 
		cash reserves uncommitted to loans, out there in the economy again, the 
		$1.8 trillion in corporate treasuries not now being invested out there 
		in the economy again.&nbsp; I think this is a net-plus.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And you know how I feel.&nbsp; I 
		think the people that benefit most should pay most.&nbsp; That's always been 
		my position -- not for class warfare reasons; for reasons of fairness in 
		rebuilding the middle class in America.&nbsp; But we have the distribution of 
		authority we have now in the Congress and what we’re going to have in 
		January, and I think this is a much, much better agreement than would be 
		reached were we to wait until January.&nbsp; And I think it will have a much 
		more positive impact on the economy.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So for whatever it’s worth, 
		that's what I think.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font color="#000048" size="2" face="Verdana"><b>President Obama:</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp; That’s 
		worth a lot.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; I 
		would like to say one other thing on another subject, just to be 
		recorded on the record.&nbsp; They don't need my support on this because we 
		have some good Republican support, including the first President Bush.&nbsp; 
		I think this START agreement is very important to the future of our 
		national security.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And it is not a radical 
		agreement.&nbsp; Boris Yeltsin and I agreed in principle on this same 
		reduction, and there was no way in the wide world he could get it 
		through the Russian Duma that existed at the time in his second term.&nbsp; 
		So we didn't proceed because it couldn’t be ratified there.&nbsp; I’m not 
		sure the Senate would have ratified it then, but I think they will not 
		with enough encouragement.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the cooperation that we 
		will get from the Russians, and the signal that will be sent to the 
		world on nonproliferation, when all these other things are going on 
		which threaten to increase nuclear proliferation, is very important.&nbsp; 
		One of the things you know is that when people fool with these weapons, 
		they're expensive to build, expensive to maintain, and expensive to 
		secure the material that goes into making the weapons.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is something that is 
		profoundly important.&nbsp; This ought to be way beyond party.&nbsp; They’ve 
		worked very hard.&nbsp; They’ve worked out, in my opinion, the details.&nbsp; And 
		I hope it will be ratified.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp; Mr. President.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		Yes.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, a lot of 
		Democrats on Capitol Hill say this is a bad deal; that President Obama 
		could have gotten more.&nbsp; What’s your message to them?&nbsp; And then if I 
		could also just ask -- well, go ahead.&nbsp; You can answer --</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		First, my message is, I don't believe that's true because in January, 
		they will be in the majority.&nbsp; And this would dramatically reduce their 
		incentive to extend unemployment benefits, to support the conversion of 
		the Make Work Pay tax credits President Obama enacted into this payroll 
		tax deduction, which as I said, I read all these economic studies.&nbsp; 
		Every single, unbiased, economic study says the best thing you can do if 
		you’re going to take a tax-cut path to grow the economy is to give 
		payroll tax relief.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I just got back from a trip 
		to Asia with my foundation.&nbsp; Hong Kong, super free-market place, had a 
		stimulus.&nbsp; Well, I guess we’re not supposed to use that word any more.&nbsp; 
		You know what they did?&nbsp; They gave almost 10 percent of the 
		people -- low-income, working people -- two months free rent in public 
		housing.&nbsp; They gave some money to the seniors.&nbsp; But the most important 
		thing they did was payroll tax relief for a year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is -- all the people 
		who study this believe it’s the number one thing, so I don't believe 
		they can get a better deal by waiting.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I think the other thing 
		that nobody is talking about, but I’m telling you it’s important, I live 
		out there now, and I do a lot of this energy work, these tax credits 
		have made us competitive again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I didn't see a single story 
		that credited Senator Reid’s election with the fact that with three 
		weeks before the election, two new plants were announced in Nevada, 
		which has the highest unemployment rate in the state, a thousand people 
		making LED lights, a thousand people making wind turbines for that big 
		wind farm in Texas, both companies owned by Chinese interests who said 
		in no uncertain terms we’re here because you decided to compete with us 
		for the future, and you gave us tax credits so we can pay higher labor 
		costs because we save the transportation costs because of these 
		credits.&nbsp; I don't believe there is a better deal out there.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp; And then as a 
		follow-up, you mentioned the Republican Congress taking office in 
		January.&nbsp; What was your advice to President Obama today about how to 
		deal with the Congress from the opposition party?</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; I 
		have a general rule which is that whatever he asked me about my advice, 
		and whatever I say should become public only if he decides to make it 
		public.&nbsp; He can say whatever he wants, but --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think?</font></p>
		<p align="left">

		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		Yes, help me.&nbsp; Thank you. Yes, go ahead.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. President, is there 
		anything else that can be done in your opinion to loosen up the private 
		credit markets that have been so tight?&nbsp; I mean if people can’t get 
		their hands on capital, how can they be the entrepreneurs that they want 
		to be?&nbsp; And this is something that the Republicans have fought all 
		along.&nbsp; What’s the next step?</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/williamclintontaxcutpresser2.jpg" width="272" height="173">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		First of all, let me just run through the numbers again.&nbsp; We’re not 
		talking about high-risk stuff.&nbsp; That's what the financial regulation 
		bill tries to stop and charges the federal regulators with -- even if 
		the Wall Street banks get -- we all know they have to be able to have 
		more leverage than the traditional community banks tend to want up in 
		the Dakotas or Arkansas or anyplace else.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But let’s start with the 
		community banks.&nbsp; If they loan money conservatively, they can loan $10 
		for every dollar they have in the bank.&nbsp; If they have $2 trillion 
		uncommitted to loans, even though some of them may have a few mortgage 
		issues unresolved, most of that mortgage debt has been off-loaded to 
		Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or has vanished into cyber-sphere with those 
		securitized subprime mortgages.&nbsp; I don't like the securities, but they 
		happened.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what I believe is going 
		on is, first of all, the business community has not come forward as 
		aggressively -- the small business community.&nbsp; And this bill did 
		preserve all those small business incentives that were enacted by the 
		Congress in the previous two years.&nbsp; There are like 16 different 
		measures that give incentives for small businesses to take loans and 
		loan guarantees and that kind of thing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It appears to me that the 
		community banks, at least, are somewhat uncertain about how the 
		financial reform bill, which I supported, applies to them and what the 
		costs of compliance might be.&nbsp; You remember, the two big things that 
		bill did was to require the federal regulators to monitor every month 
		the big banks that caused the meltdown and to require them to set aside 
		more capital.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then it set up an 
		orderly bankruptcy mechanism and banned future bailouts.&nbsp; It said -- 
		that bill actually says:&nbsp; If this happens again, the shareholders and 
		the executives have to eat it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there’s a whole lot of 
		other things in credit cards and other matters that deal with it.&nbsp; I 
		think it is really, really important just to do an aggressive, 100 
		percent information drench.&nbsp; I mean I would go so far as to do it bank 
		by bank by bank by bank so that everybody knows exactly what they have 
		to do, exactly what it costs and how quickly this can all be resolved.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And then I think it’s 
		important to make sure that all these community banks and the people who 
		might borrow from them understand where the small businesses of America 
		are and where the manufacturers are with the various loan guarantees and 
		credits and deductions that are available under these laws.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I still think -- you know, 
		we too often assume that when a law passes, people know it passed, and 
		they know what’s in it, and they know how it applies to them.&nbsp; That may 
		not be true in this case because there’s been so much activity and so 
		much debate about it that was a debate that occurred in the context of a 
		campaign rather than in the context of, “Let me tell you how this works, 
		come here, let’s figure out how to get you a loan.”&nbsp; So in my opinion, 
		that's what needs to be done over the next two or three months.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The money is there to get 
		this country out of this mess.&nbsp; Two trillion dollars in the bank is $20 
		trillion in loans.&nbsp; Now, there’s not that much guaranteed, but there’s 
		plenty.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I also believe the same 
		thing with big companies.&nbsp; We should analyze the situation of every 
		company that at a minimum has got a $1 billion or more in cash and ask 
		them to be honest with us about what would it take to get you back in 
		the investment business.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These companies clearly have 
		a preference for reinvesting in America, or they’d have put this money 
		somewhere else already.&nbsp; They have got -- it’s an amazing thing, $1.8 
		trillion in corporate treasuries, 6.2 percent of their capitalized 
		value.&nbsp; It’s been since 1964 that they had those kind of cash balances 
		relative to their value.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So those are the things that 
		I think we have to do now, so I can’t answer your question, except the

		Democrats are saying that the President just didn't go in and fight hard 
		enough for his core principles; that he caved in.&nbsp; Politically, some say 
		that he should be a one-term President.&nbsp; Has he damaged not only his own 
		political path, but has he let the party down?</font></p>

		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; I 
		don't believe so.&nbsp; I think -- I just respectfully disagree about that.&nbsp; 
		I think that a lot of -- look, a lot of them are hurting now.&nbsp; And I get 
		it.&nbsp; And you know I did 133 events for them.&nbsp; I believe the Congress in 
		the last two years did a far better job than the American people thought 
		they did, at least the American people that voted in the midterms.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I went to extraordinary 
		efforts to try to explain what I thought had been done in the ways that 
		I thought were most favorable to them.&nbsp; But we had an election.&nbsp; The 
		results are what they are.&nbsp; The numbers will only get worse in January 
		in terms of negotiating.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the President -- look, 
		if we had 5 percent growth and unemployment was dropping like a rock, 
		maybe you could have a so-called Mexican standoff, and you could say, it 
		will be you, not me, the voters will hold responsible for raising taxes 
		on middle-class people if they all go down next year.&nbsp; That is not the 
		circumstance we face.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The United States has 
		suffered a severe financial collapse.&nbsp; These things take longer to get 
		over than normal recessions.&nbsp; We must first make sure we keep getting 
		over it.&nbsp; We don’t want to slip back down as Japan did.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And in order to make it 
		happen over the long run, that’s why the question I was just asked is so 
		good, is we have to go beyond direct investments, whether they’re 
		stimulus projects or tax cuts, to private growth.&nbsp; But to get there, we 
		have to achieve a higher level of growth that triggers a confidence. &nbsp;So I personally believe this 
		is a good deal and the best he could have gotten under the 
		circumstances. I just disagree.&nbsp; I 
		understand why -- people have a right to disagree with him.&nbsp; But I

		different.&nbsp; And you know, I’m -- I’ll let you do that.&nbsp; I’m out of

		shutdowns.&nbsp; We can’t afford that now.&nbsp; The only reason we could do that

		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can’t afford that.&nbsp; We

		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		Yes.&nbsp; I had a long talk with the Prime Minister today.&nbsp; And he, first of 
		all, has done I think a remarkable job of being a loyal prime minister, 
		but not being involved in the political imbroglio that’s going on, 
		except to try to keep calm.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There was a decision made by 
		the electoral council to review the vote in its entirety and to ask some 
		outside observers to come in who are not only credible but 
		knowledgeable.&nbsp; And they will announce exactly how they propose to do 
		that.&nbsp; Today was a pretty calm day.&nbsp; And they expect the weekend to be 
		pretty calm.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are going to have our 
		commission meeting next week.&nbsp; We may move it to the Dominican 
		Republic.&nbsp; But I think the best thing that we can do for the people of

		still committed to the long-term reconstruction process, whoever gets 
		elected president.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The best thing they can do 
		is -- everyone understands they had to carry out this election under 
		enormously difficult circumstances.&nbsp; Even getting the ID cards to 
		everybody, as you know, proved difficult, because they were in those 
		tented areas.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But what I can say is it was

		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. President, I have 
		to ask, do you think your appearance here today will help sway votes 
		where they’re needed the most right now, among House Democrats?</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; I 
		have no idea.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I ask you 
		that is because a lot of them are sort of antsy.&nbsp; And I know you never 
		used the term back in your first term, but they’re antsy about the 
		precedent of triangulation.&nbsp; They’re still smarting over that.&nbsp; And your 
		appearance here today might not necessarily push them in the direction 
		that the President wants them to be pushed.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		That’s right, it may not.&nbsp; But I would like to -- you know, I told 
		President Obama, and I’ll tell you, you ought to go back and read a 
		lecture that Franklin Roosevelt gave in 1926 before he was the Vice 
		Presidential nominee, before he came down with polio, to his old alma 
		mater [inaudible], in which he discussed the dilemma of the progressive 
		movement in American politics.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have an enormous amount of 
		respect for the Democrats in the House.&nbsp; And I’ve already told you I 
		regret that so many of them lost.&nbsp; I think some of our best people 
		lost.&nbsp; And I get where they’re coming from.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I can only tell you that my 
		economic analysis is that given all the alternatives that I can imagine 
		actually becoming law, this is the best economic result for America.&nbsp; 
		And I think it is enormous relief for America to think that both parties 
		might vote for something, anything that they could both agree on.&nbsp; And 
		there is no way you can have a compromise without having something in 
		the bill that you don’t like.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I don’t know if I can 
		influence anybody.&nbsp; Heck, I couldn’t -- you know, I’d go some places and 
		the people I campaigned for won.&nbsp; In some places, the people I 
		campaigned for lost.&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp; All I can tell you is what I think.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering your 
		credibility on the deficit, what do you think about concerns about the 
		short-term deficit and the long-term deficit, and where our country is 
		going?</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		I’m happy to address that because I don’t think that -- I don’t think I 
		did a good enough job in this election season, obviously, and I’m not 
		sure we did.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The difference between now 
		and when I became President, when we immediately went after the deficit, 
		is quite simple.&nbsp; When I became President, it was after 12 years in 
		which the accumulative debt of the country had risen from $1 to $4 
		trillion.&nbsp; It was the first period in American history when we had ever 
		run structural deficits of any size.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so we were having to pay 
		too much for money.&nbsp; It was costing us a lot to borrow money in the 
		public sector, taking I think it was 14 cents of every dollar on the 
		debt at the time.&nbsp; And it was crowding out the opportunity of the 
		private sector to borrow money, and raising their cost.&nbsp; And that’s 
		sparked the recession that we had in the early ‘90s.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What happened this time was 
		totally different.&nbsp; This time there was a collapse of a financial 
		system, which took interest rates to zero.&nbsp; Now, I know there’s a lot of 
		alarm now.&nbsp; People say, oh, the interest rates went up on bond and in 
		debt in the last couple of days.&nbsp; And they said, oh, is it because of 
		the increase in the -- increasing the deficit in the short term?&nbsp; Is it 
		because of the economy growing?&nbsp; That doesn’t bother me.&nbsp; We have to get 
		out of deflation.&nbsp; The biggest problem we have now is deflation.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, look, I’m a 
		Depression-era kid.&nbsp; I don’t like deficits ever, really.&nbsp; We had four 
		surpluses when I was President.&nbsp; That’s what I like.&nbsp; I like balanced 
		budgets and surpluses; when you have growth.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But if I were in office now, 
		I would have done what the President has done.&nbsp; You have to first put 
		the brakes on a contracting economy.&nbsp; And then you have to somehow hold 
		it together until growth resumes.&nbsp; When growth resumes, you have to have 
		interest rates higher than zero.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So you should actually -- 
		now, if they get too high, you’ll be alarmed.&nbsp; But you should be 
		encouraged that interest rates are beginning to creep up again.&nbsp; It’s 
		the sign of a healthy economy, and the idea that there would be 
		competition for money.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I do believe that we’ll have 
		to take aggressive and disciplined action to eliminate the structural 
		deficit again.&nbsp; And I think it was a mistake to go back to structural 
		deficits.&nbsp; I think if America were out of debt on a normal basis, and we 
		didn’t have to borrow money from our major trading partners, we would 
		have more economic freedom and economic security.&nbsp; So I want to see what 
		comes out of this, but I expect to support some very vigorous actions to 
		eliminate the deficit and get us back to balance.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, one more.&nbsp; I’ve got to 
		get out of here.&nbsp; Go ahead.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. 
		President.&nbsp; Beyond this pending tax deal, there are enormous issues of 
		importance that are unfinished, from education to energy, the deficit.&nbsp; 
		And this is still a very dividing country.&nbsp; Do you think the American 
		people want a President to compromise with the opposing party?&nbsp; And is 
		that a message that you think Democrats are going to have to accept?</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<img border="1" src="../../images/willamclintontaxcutpresser4.jpg" width="272" height="173">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		Yes, but I also believe that it’s a message Republicans are going to 
		have to accept.&nbsp; Keep in mind that many of the -- the really interesting 
		thing was -- is that a lot of the hardcore conservatives think the 
		Republicans gave too much.&nbsp; Read Charles Krauthammer’s column in the 
		Post today.&nbsp; He’s a brilliant man, and he pointed out that they got the 
		divisive tax cuts, but most of them were targeted to middle-class 
		working people -- that's what the payroll tax cut is -- that the 
		unemployment benefits were extended, which some of them did not want to 
		do, and that the American people, by two to one, support them both.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So there are some 
		conservatives who don't believe in the economic theory I just advanced 
		to you; who believe that the President and Democrats got more out of 
		this than the Republicans did. So I think that's healthy, 
		too, because everybody has got to give a little.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, I think the one thing 
		that always happens when you have divided government is that people no 
		longer see principled compromise as weakness.&nbsp; This system was set up to 
		promote principled compromise.&nbsp; It is an ethical thing to do.&nbsp; In a 
		democracy where no one is a dictator, we would all be at each other’s 
		throats all the time, and we would be in a state of constant paralysis 
		if once power is divided, there is no compromise.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><font color="#CE0A04">Question:</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s the political 
		fight worth having?&nbsp; What would you tell Democrats the political fight 
		worth having is right now?</font></p>
		<p align="left">
		<font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<b><font color="#000048">Former President Clinton:</font></b>&nbsp; 
		Well, I think it’s worth fighting against the repeal of the health care 
		law.&nbsp; I would be in favor -- and I can give you four or five things off 
		the top of my head I think should be done to improve it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think it’s worth a 
		ferocious fight to avoid repeal of the student loan reform, which I 
		believe is the best chance we’ve got to take America back to number one 
		from number nine in the percent of adults in the world with four-year 
		college degrees.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think it’s worth fighting 
		against repeal of the financial reform and the assurance it gives us 
		that we won’t have another meltdown, and if we do, there won’t be 
		another bailout.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think there are a lot of 
		fights worth having, and I presume the Republicans want to fight those, 
		too, since they ran on that.&nbsp; And they’ll be able to have these 
		differences.&nbsp; But this holds the promise that after the fights are over, 
		we’ll be able to find principled compromises on those areas, as well.&nbsp; 
		And to me that's worth doing.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But first, the economy 
		first.&nbsp; We can’t go back into a recession.&nbsp; We have to keep crawling out 
		of this mess we’re in.&nbsp; And this is a good first step, both on the 
		substantive merits and on the psychological relief it gives to the 
		American people in general, and the small business people and community 
		bankers and others who can start doing things that will help get better 
		in particular.</font></p>
