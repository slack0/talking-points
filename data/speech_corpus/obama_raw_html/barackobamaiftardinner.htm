<p align="left"><font size="1" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">[AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below 
transcribed directly from audio]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, welcome to the White House.&nbsp; To 
		you, to Muslim Americans across our country, and to more than one 
		billion Muslims around the world, I extend my best wishes on this holy 
		month.&nbsp; Ramadan Kareem.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I want to welcome members of 
		the diplomatic corps; members of my administration; and members of 
		Congress, including Rush Holt, John Conyers, and Andre Carson, who is 
		one of two Muslim American members of Congress, along with Keith 
		Ellison.&nbsp; So welcome, all of you.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here at the White House, we 
		have a tradition of hosting iftars that goes back several years, just as 
		we host Christmas parties and seders and Diwali celebrations.&nbsp; And these 
		events celebrate the role of faith in the lives of the American people. 
		They remind us of the basic truth that we are all children of God, and 
		we all draw strength and a sense of purpose from our beliefs.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These events are also an 
		affirmation of who we are as Americans.&nbsp; Our Founders understood that 
		the best way to honor the place of faith in the lives of our people was 
		to protect their freedom to practice religion.&nbsp; In the Virginia Act of 
		Establishing Religion Freedom, Thomas Jefferson wrote that “all men 
		shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in 
		matters of religion.”&nbsp; The First Amendment of our Constitution 
		established the freedom of religion as the law of the land.&nbsp; And that 
		right has been upheld ever since.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, over the course of 
		our history, religion has flourished within our borders precisely 
		because Americans have had the right to worship as they choose -- 
		including the right to believe in no religion at all.&nbsp; And it is a 
		testament to the wisdom of our Founders that America remains deeply 
		religious -- a nation where the ability of peoples of different faiths 
		to coexist peacefully and with mutual respect for one another stands in 
		stark contrast to the religious conflict that persists elsewhere around 
		the globe.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, that's not to say that 
		religion is without controversy. Recently, attention has been focused on 
		the construction of mosques in certain communities -- particularly New 
		York.&nbsp; Now, we must all recognize and respect the sensitivities 
		surrounding the development of Lower Manhattan.&nbsp; The 9/11 attacks were a 
		deeply traumatic event for our country.&nbsp; And the pain and the experience 
		of suffering by those who lost loved ones is just unimaginable.&nbsp; So I 
		understand the emotions that this issue engenders.&nbsp; And Ground Zero is, 
		indeed, hallowed ground.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But let me be clear.&nbsp; As a 
		citizen, and as President, I believe that Muslims have the same right to 
		practice their religion as everyone else in this country.&nbsp; And that includes the right to build a place of worship and a community 
		center on private property in Lower Manhattan, in accordance with local 
		laws and ordinances.&nbsp; This is America.&nbsp; And our commitment to religious 
		freedom must be unshakeable.&nbsp; The principle that people of all faiths 
		are welcome in this country and that they will not be treated 
		differently by their government is essential to who we are.&nbsp; The writ of 
		the Founders must endure.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We must never forget those 
		who we lost so tragically on 9/11, and we must always honor those who 
		led the response to that attack -- from the firefighters who charged up 
		smoke-filled staircases, to our troops who are serving in Afghanistan 
		today. And let us also remember who we’re fighting against, and what 
		we’re fighting for.&nbsp; Our enemies respect no religious freedom.&nbsp; Al 
		Qaeda’s cause is not Islam -- it’s a gross distortion of Islam.&nbsp; These 
		are not religious leaders -- they’re terrorists who murder innocent men 
		and women and children.&nbsp; In fact, al Qaeda has killed more Muslims than 
		people of any other religion -- and that list of victims includes 
		innocent Muslims who were killed on 9/11.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So that's who we’re fighting 
		against.&nbsp; And the reason that we will win this fight is not simply the 
		strength of our arms -- it is the strength of our values.&nbsp; The democracy 
		that we uphold. The freedoms that we cherish.&nbsp; The laws that we apply 
		without regard to race, or religion, or wealth, or status.&nbsp; Our capacity 
		to show not merely tolerance, but respect towards those who are 
		different from us -- and that way of life, that quintessentially 
		American creed, stands in stark contrast to the nihilism of those who 
		attacked us on that September morning, and who continue to plot against 
		us today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In my 
		<a href="barackobamainauguraladdress.htm"><font color="#0000FF">inaugural address</font></a> I 
		said that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.&nbsp; We are 
		a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and 
		non-believers.&nbsp; We are shaped by every language and every culture, drawn 
		from every end of this Earth.&nbsp; And that diversity can bring difficult 
		debates.&nbsp; This is not unique to our time.&nbsp; Past eras have seen 
		controversies about the construction of synagogues or Catholic 
		churches.&nbsp; But time and again, the American people have demonstrated 
		that we can work through these issues, and stay true to our core values, 
		and emerge stronger for it.&nbsp; So it must be -- and will be -- today.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And tonight, we are reminded 
		that Ramadan is a celebration of a faith known for great diversity.&nbsp; And 
		Ramadan is a reminder that Islam has always been a part of America.&nbsp; The 
		first Muslim ambassador to the United States, from Tunisia, was hosted 
		by President Jefferson, who arranged a sunset dinner for his guest 
		because it was 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan_(calendar_month)">
		<font color="#0000FF">Ramadan</font></a> -- making it the first known
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iftar"><font color="#0000FF">iftar</font></a> at the White 
		House, more than 200 years ago.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like so many other 
		immigrants, generations of Muslims came to forge their future here.&nbsp; 
		They became farmers and merchants, worked in mills and factories.&nbsp; They 
		helped lay the railroads.&nbsp; They helped to build America.&nbsp; They founded 
		the first Islamic center in New York City in the 1890s.&nbsp; They built 
		America’s first mosque on the prairie of North Dakota.&nbsp; And perhaps the 
		oldest surviving mosque in America -- still in use today -- is in Cedar 
		Rapids, Iowa.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Today, our nation is 
		strengthened by millions of Muslim Americans.&nbsp; They excel in every walk 
		of life.&nbsp; Muslim American communities -- including mosques in all 50 
		states -- also serve their neighbors.&nbsp; Muslim Americans protect our 
		communities as police officers and firefighters and first responders.&nbsp; 
		Muslim American clerics have spoken out against terror and extremism, 
		reaffirming that Islam teaches that one must save human life, not take 
		it.&nbsp; And Muslim Americans serve with honor in our military. At next 
		week’s iftar at the Pentagon, tribute will be paid to three soldiers who 
		gave their lives in Iraq and now rest among the heroes of Arlington 
		National Cemetery.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These Muslim Americans died 
		for the security that we depend on, and the freedoms that we cherish.&nbsp; 
		They are part of an unbroken line of Americans that stretches back to 
		our founding; Americans of all faiths who have served and sacrificed to 
		extend the promise of America to new generations, and to ensure that 
		what is exceptional about America is protected -- our commitment to stay 
		true to our core values, and our ability slowly but surely to perfect 
		our union.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For in the end, we remain 
		“one nation, under God, indivisible.”&nbsp; And we can only achieve “liberty 
		and justice for all” if we live by that one rule at the heart of every 
		great religion, including Islam -- that we do unto others as we would 
		have them do unto us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So thank you all for being 
		here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I wish you a blessed Ramadan.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And with that, let us eat.</font></p>
