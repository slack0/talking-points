audio. (2)]</font></font></p>

</font>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On behalf of the great state of Illinois, 
crossroads of a nation, Land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for 
the privilege of addressing this convention.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tonight is a particular honor for me because, 
let’s face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a 
foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding 
goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father -- my grandfather -- was a 
cook, a domestic servant to the British.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But my grandfather had larger dreams for his 
son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in 
a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to 
so many who had come before.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While studying here, my father met my mother. 
She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father 
worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl 
Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty; joined Patton’s army, marched across 
Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber 
assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house 
through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of 
opportunity.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And they, too, had big dreams for their 
daughter. A common dream, born of two continents.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My parents shared not only an improbable love, 
they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would 
give me an African name, Barack, or ”blessed,” believing that in a tolerant 
America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- They imagined me 
going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren’t rich, because in 
a generous America you don’t have to be rich to achieve your potential.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">They're both passed away now. And yet, I know 
that on this night they look down on me with great pride.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They stand here, and I stand here today, 
grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents’ dreams live on 
in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the 
larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and 
that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of 
our Nation -- not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our 
military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple 
premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago: </font></p>
<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are 
		Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</font></i></p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is the true genius of America, a faith -- 
a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles; that we can tuck in 
our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm; 
that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden 
knock on the door; that we can have an idea and start our own business without 
paying a bribe; that we can participate in the political process without fear of 
retribution, and that our votes will be counted -- at least most of the time.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This year, in this election we are called to 
reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and 
see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of 
future generations.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, 
Independents, I say to you tonight: We have more work to do --&nbsp; more work 
to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union 
jobs at the Maytag plant that’s moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete 
with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour; more to do for 
the father that I met who was losing his job and choking back the tears, 
wondering how he would pay 4500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs 
without the health benefits that he counted on; more to do for the young woman 
in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the 
drive, has the will, but doesn’t have the money to go to college.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, don’t get me wrong. The people I meet -- 
in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks -- they don’t expect 
government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get 
ahead,&nbsp; and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and 
people will tell you they don’t want their tax money wasted, by a welfare agency 
or by the Pentagon. Go in -- Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will 
tell you that government alone can’t teach our kids to learn; they know that 
parents have to teach, that children can’t achieve unless we raise their 
expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that 
says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">People don’t expect -- People don't expect 
government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, 
that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child 
in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain 
open to all.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">They know we can do better. And they want that 
choice.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this election, we offer that choice. Our 
Party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to 
offer. And that man is John Kerry.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%">
<font size="2" face="Verdana">John Kerry understands the ideals of community, 
faith, and service because they’ve defined his life. From his heroic service to 
Vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two 
decades in the United States Senate, he's devoted himself to this country. Again 
and again, we’ve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">His values and his record affirm what is 
best in us. John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded; so 
instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he offers 
them to companies creating jobs here at home.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">John Kerry believes in an America where all 
Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have 
for themselves.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">John Kerry believes in energy independence, so 
we aren’t held hostage to the profits of oil companies, or the sabotage of 
foreign oil fields.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">John Kerry believes in the Constitutional 
freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never 
sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous 
world war must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, a while back -- awhile back I met a 
young man named Shamus in a V.F.W. Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a 
good-looking kid -- six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easy smile. He told 
me he’d joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. And as I 
listened to him explain why he’d enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our 
country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young 
man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But then I asked myself, &quot;Are we serving Shamus 
as well as he is serving us?&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I thought of the 900 men and women -- sons and 
daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won’t be returning to 
their own hometowns. I thought of the families I’ve met who were struggling to 
get by without a loved one’s full income, or whose loved ones had returned with 
a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefits 
because they were Reservists.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When we send our young men and women into 
harm’s way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the 
truth about why they’re going, to care for their families while they’re gone, to 
tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without 
enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the 
world.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now -- Now let me be clear. Let me be clear. We 
have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be 
pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as 
Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served 
with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our 
military might to keep America safe and secure.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">John Kerry believes in America. And he knows 
that it’s not enough for just some of us to prosper -- for alongside our famous 
individualism, there’s another ingredient in the American saga,&nbsp; a belief 
that we’re all connected as one people. If there is a child on the south side of 
Chicago who can’t read, that matters to me, even if it’s not my child. If there 
is a senior citizen somewhere who can’t pay for their prescription drugs, and 
having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even 
if it’s not my grandparent. If there’s an Arab American family being rounded up 
without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil 
liberties.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is that fundamental belief -- It is that 
fundamental belief: I am my brother’s keeper. I am my sister’s keeper that makes 
this country work. It’s what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet 
still come together as one American family.</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
		<i>E pluribus unum</i>: &quot;Out of many, one.&quot;</font></p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now even as we speak, there are those who are 
preparing to divide us -- the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace 
the politics of &quot;anything goes.&quot; Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a 
liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of 
America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and 
Asian America -- there’s the United States of America.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The pundits, the pundits like to 
slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for 
Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I’ve got news for them, too. We 
worship an awesome 
God in the blue states, and we don’t like federal agents poking around in our 
libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and yes, 
we’ve got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the 
war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one 
people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us 
defending the United States of America.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end -- In the end -- In the end, that’s 
what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do 
we participate in a politics of hope?</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards 
calls on us to hope.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’m not talking about blind optimism here -- 
the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just 
don’t think about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just 
ignore it. That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about something more 
substantial. It’s the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom 
songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a 
young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a 
millworker’s son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a 
funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hope -- Hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in 
the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope!</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end, that is God’s greatest gift to us, 
the bedrock of this nation. A belief in things not seen. A belief that there are 
better days ahead.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believe that we can give our middle class 
relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, 
homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from 
violence and despair.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I believe that we have a righteous wind at our 
backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right 
choices, and meet the challenges that face us.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America! Tonight, if you feel the same energy 
that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion 
that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do -- if we do what we must 
do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, 
from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry 
will be sworn in as President, and John Edwards will be sworn in as Vice 
President, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long 
political darkness a brighter day will come.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much everybody.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">God bless you.</font></p>
