		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thank you.&nbsp; Thank you, everybody.&nbsp; Please be seated.&nbsp; Hello, Giants.&nbsp; It 
		is good -- It is good to be here, and congratulations Class of 2010.&nbsp; I 
		am honored to be part of this special occasion.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#CE0A04">
		Audience Member:</font></b>&nbsp; We love 
		you!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#00002D">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; And I love 
		you back.&nbsp; Let me acknowledge your extraordinary governor, Jennifer Granholm.&nbsp; Superintendent Rice, thank you for your inspiring words.&nbsp; 
		Your mayor, Bobby Hopewell, who I understand is a proud Kalamazoo 
		graduate himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thanks to Principal 
		Washington for -- not just for the warm introduction, but for his 
		enthusiasm and his energy and his leadership and his nice singing 
		voice.&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp; To all the trustees, to the alumni, to the parents, 
		grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins -- everybody who’s been a part of 
		this extraordinary place.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And I want to recognize our 
		student speakers.&nbsp; Cindy, who embodies the best of our traditions in 
		this country -- arrived three or four years ago and graduates as the 
		valedictorian -- this is what is continually replenishing the energy and 
		the dynamism and the innovation of this country, and we could not be 
		prouder of you.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; And to Simon, I’m glad that, according to 
		the Constitution, you can’t run till you’re 35.&nbsp;So I’ll be long gone by 
		then.&nbsp;But it gives me great confidence to know that we’ve got such 
		incredible young leaders who are going to be remaking the world in so 
		many different ways.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, recently, an article 
		from your local paper, the Kalamazoo Gazette -- was brought to my 
		attention.&nbsp; And it ran just after this school had been chosen as one of 
		the six finalists in our Race to the Top Commencement Challenge.&nbsp; And 
		for those who aren’t aware of it, this is a contest to highlight schools 
		that promote academic excellence, personal responsibility and that best 
		prepare students for college and careers.&nbsp; And this article in the 
		Gazette quoted a young lady named Kelsey Wilson. Where is -- Is Kelsey 
		here?&nbsp; She right over there?&nbsp; Anyway --</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#CE0A04">
		Audience Member:</font></b>&nbsp; She’s 
		here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#00002D">
		President Obama:</font></b>&nbsp; She’s over 
		there?&nbsp; Hey, Kelsey.&nbsp; How are you?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So Kelsey was quoted as 
		saying, “We’re the kind of school that never gets credit for what we 
		do.&nbsp; And our school is amazing.”&nbsp; This is what Kelsey said, “Our school 
		is amazing.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, Kelsey, Class of 2010, 
		members of the Kalamazoo community, I’m here tonight because after three 
		rounds of competition, with more than a thousand schools, and more than 
		170,000 votes cast, I know -- and America knows -- what you’ve done at 
		Kalamazoo Central.&nbsp; You are amazing!&nbsp; We know.&nbsp; We know.&nbsp; Our amazing 
		Secretary of Education Arne Duncan knows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Folks in Washington 
		know, folks across the country know, and hopefully after tonight, 
		everybody knows.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, together as a 
		community, you’ve embraced the motto of this school district:&nbsp; “Every 
		child, every opportunity, every time.”&nbsp; Every time.&nbsp; Every child, every 
		opportunity, every time, because you believe, like I do, that every 
		young person, every child -- regardless of what they look like, where 
		they come from, how much money their parents have -- every child who 
		walks through your schoolhouse doors deserves a quality education.&nbsp; No 
		exceptions.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And I’m here tonight because 
		I think that America has a lot to learn from Kalamazoo Central about 
		what makes for a successful school in this new century.&nbsp; You’ve got 
		educators raising standards and then inspiring their students to meet 
		them.&nbsp; You’ve got community members who are stepping up as tutors and 
		mentors and coaches.&nbsp; You got parents who are taking an active interest 
		in their child’s education -- attending those teacher conferences, yes, 
		turning off the TV once in a while, making sure homework gets done.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Arne Duncan is here tonight 
		because these are the values, these are the changes that he’s 
		encouraging in every school in this nation.&nbsp; It’s the key to our future.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the most important 
		ingredient is you:&nbsp; students who raised your sights, who aimed high, who 
		invested yourselves in your own success.&nbsp; It’s no accident that so many 
		of you have received college admissions letters, Class of 2010.&nbsp; That 
		didn’t happen by accident.&nbsp; It happened because you worked for it.&nbsp; As 
		the superintendent said, you earned it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, Kelsey, I agree with 
		you.&nbsp; What you’ve done here at Kalamazoo Central is amazing.&nbsp; I am proud 
		of you.&nbsp; Your parents are proud of you.&nbsp; Your teachers, your principal 
		-- we’re all incredibly proud.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, graduates, all these 
		folks around you, I have to say, though, with the cameras and the 
		beaming smiles -- they’ve worked hard to give you everything you need to 
		pursue your dreams and fulfill your God-given talent.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
		you can’t take them with you when you leave here.&nbsp; No one is going to go 
		follow you around making sure that you’re getting to class on time, 
		making sure you’re doing your work.&nbsp; Nobody is going to be doing that 
		for you.&nbsp; Going forward, that’s all on you -- responsibility for your 
		success is squarely on your shoulders.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And the question I have for 
		you today is this:&nbsp; What is each -- what are each of you going to do to 
		meet that responsibility?&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, right now you’re 
		getting plenty of advice from everybody.&nbsp; Some of it’s helpful.&nbsp; And so 
		I hate to pile on with advice.&nbsp; But while I’m here -- what the heck.&nbsp; I 
		figure I should offer a few thoughts based on my own experiences, but 
		also based on my hopes for all of you, and for our country, in the years 
		ahead.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First, understand that your 
		success in life won’t be determined just by what’s given to you, or what 
		happens to you, but by what you do with all that’s given to you; what 
		you do with all that happens to you; how hard you try; how far you push 
		yourself; how high you’re willing to reach.&nbsp; True excellence only comes 
		with perseverance.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This wasn’t something I 
		really understood when I was back your age.&nbsp; My father, some of you 
		know, left my family when I was two years old.&nbsp; I was raised by a single 
		mom and my grandparents.&nbsp; And sometimes I had a tendency to goof off.&nbsp; 
		As my mother put it, I had a tendency sometimes to act a bit casual 
		about my future.&nbsp; Sometimes I was rebellious.&nbsp; Sometimes I partied a 
		little too much.&nbsp; Oh, yes, yes, this is a cautionary tale.&nbsp; Don’t be 
		cheering when I say that.&nbsp; Studied just enough to get by.&nbsp; I thought 
		hard work, responsibility, that’s old-fashioned.&nbsp; That’s just people 
		want to tell me what to do.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But after a few years, after 
		I was living solely on my own and I realized that living solely for my 
		own entertainment wasn’t so entertaining anymore, that it wasn’t 
		particularly satisfying anymore, that I didn’t seem to be making much of 
		a ripple in the world, I started to change my tune.&nbsp; I realized that by 
		refusing to apply myself, there was nothing I could point to that I was 
		proud of that would last.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, you come of an age in a 
		popular culture that actually reinforces this approach to life.&nbsp; You 
		watch TV, and basically what it says is you can be rich and successful 
		without much effort; you just have to become a celebrity.&nbsp; If you can 
		achieve some reality TV notoriety, that’s better than lasting 
		achievement.&nbsp; We live in a culture that tells you there’s a quick fix 
		for every problem and a justification for every selfish desire.&nbsp; And all 
		of you were raised with cell phones and iPods, and texting and emails, 
		and you’re able to call up a fact, or a song, or a friend with the click 
		of a button.&nbsp; So you’re used to instant gratification.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But meaningful achievement, 
		lasting success -- it doesn’t happen in an instant.&nbsp; It’s not about 
		luck, it’s not about a sudden stroke of genius.&nbsp; It’s not usually about 
		talent.&nbsp; It’s usually about daily effort, the large choices and the 
		small choices that you make that add up over time.&nbsp; It’s about the 
		skills you build, and the knowledge you accumulate, and the energy you 
		invest in every task, no matter how trivial or menial it may seem at the 
		time.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You’ve got an alum who plays 
		for the Yankees, I hear.&nbsp; He’s supposed to be pretty good.&nbsp; Now, Derek 
		Jeter wasn’t born playing shortstop for the Yankees.&nbsp; He got there 
		through years of effort.&nbsp; And his high school baseball coach once 
		remarked, “I’m surprised he still doesn’t have blisters and that I don’t 
		have the blisters on my hands from hitting ground balls just for 
		Derek.”&nbsp; He always wanted more:&nbsp; ‘How about one more turn in the batting 
		cage?&nbsp; Or 25 more ground balls?’”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thomas Edison tested more 
		than 6,000 different materials for just one tiny part of the light bulb 
		that he invented.&nbsp; Think about that -- 6,000 tests.&nbsp; J.K. Rowling’s 
		first Harry Potter book was rejected 12 times before it was finally 
		published.&nbsp; Mozart was a musical prodigy, but he practiced for hours 
		each day -- accumulating thousands of hours at the piano by the time he 
		was just six years old.&nbsp; I understand that your boys’ basketball team 
		did pretty good.&nbsp; First state champions for the first time in 59 years.&nbsp; 
		That didn’t happen by accident.&nbsp; They put in work.&nbsp; They put in effort.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, today, you all have a 
		rare and valuable chance to pursue your own passions, chase your own 
		dreams without incurring a mountain of debt.&nbsp; What an incredible gift.&nbsp; 
		So you’ve got no excuse for giving anything less than your best effort.&nbsp; 
		No excuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s my second piece of 
		advice, very simple:&nbsp; Don’t make excuses.&nbsp; Take responsibility not just 
		for your successes; take responsibility where you fall short as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, the truth is, no matter 
		how hard you work, you’re not going to ace every class -- well, maybe 
		Cindy will, but -- but you’re not going to ace every class.&nbsp; You’re not 
		going to succeed the first time you try something.&nbsp; There are going to 
		be times when you screw up.&nbsp; There will be times where you hurt people 
		you love.&nbsp; There will be times where you make a mistake and you stray 
		from the values that you hold most deeply.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And when that happens, it’s 
		the easiest thing in the world to start looking around for somebody else 
		to blame.&nbsp; Your professor was too hard; your boss was a jerk; the 
		coaches -- was playing favorites; your friend just didn’t understand.&nbsp; 
		Your wife -- oh, no.&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m just messing with Michelle right there.&nbsp; 
		That was all in fun.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No, but this is an easy 
		habit to get into.&nbsp; You see it every day in Washington -- every day -- 
		folks calling each other names, making all sorts of accusations on 
		television.&nbsp; Everybody is always pointing a finger at somebody else.&nbsp; 
		You notice that?&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, this community could 
		have easily gone down that road.&nbsp; This community could have made excuses 
		-- well, our kids have fewer advantages, our schools have fewer 
		resources -- how can we compete?&nbsp; You could have spent years pointing 
		fingers -- blaming parents, blaming teachers, blaming the principal, 
		blaming the superintendent, blaming the President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But that’s -- Class of 2010, 
		I want you to pay attention on this because that’s not what happened.&nbsp; 
		Instead, this community was honest with itself about where you were 
		falling short.&nbsp; You resolved to do better, push your kids harder, open 
		their minds wider, expose them to all kinds of ideas and people and 
		experiences.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, graduates, I hope you’ll 
		continue those efforts.&nbsp; Don’t make excuses.&nbsp; And I hope that wherever 
		you go, you won’t narrow the broad intellectual and social exposure 
		you’ve had here at Kalamazoo Central -- instead, seek to expand it.&nbsp; 
		Don’t just hang out with people who look like you, or go to the same 
		church you do, or share your political views.&nbsp; Broaden your circle to 
		include people with different backgrounds and life experiences.&nbsp; Because 
		that’s how you’ll end up learning what it’s like to walk in somebody 
		else’s shoes.&nbsp; That’s how you’ll come to understand the challenges other 
		people face.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And this is not just an 
		academic exercise.&nbsp; It’s a way to broaden your ambit of concern and 
		learn to see yourselves in each other.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which brings me to my final 
		piece of advice for today, and that’s to give back, to be part of 
		something bigger than yourselves.&nbsp; Hitch your wagon to something that is 
		bigger than yourselves.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I know that so many of you 
		have already served your community through efforts like your Stuff the 
		Bus food drives and groups like Activists for Action.&nbsp; And I commend you 
		for that.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But I also know that many of 
		you are the first in your family to go to college.&nbsp; And right about now, 
		you may be feeling all the weight of their hopes and expectations coming 
		down on your shoulders.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And once you start juggling 
		those classes and activities and that campus job, and you get caught up 
		in your own dreams and your own anxieties and dating -- you may feel 
		like you’ve got enough on your plate just dealing with your own life.&nbsp; 
		It might be easier to turn the channel when the news disturbs you, to 
		avert your eyes when you pass that homeless man on the street, to tell 
		yourself that other people’s problems really aren’t your responsibility.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But just think about what 
		the consequence of that approach to life would have been if that’s how 
		folks had acted here in this community.&nbsp; What if those Kalamazoo Promise 
		donors had said to themselves, “Well, you know what, I can pay for my 
		own kid’s education.&nbsp; Why should I have to pay for somebody else’s?”&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Think about the consequences 
		for our country.&nbsp; What if our Founding Fathers had said, “You know, 
		colonialism is kind of oppressive, but I’m doing okay, my family’s doing 
		all right, why should I spend my summer in Philadelphia arguing about a 
		Constitution?”&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What if those abolitionists, 
		those civil right workers had said, “You know, slavery is wrong, 
		segregation is wrong, but it’s kind of dangerous to get mixed up in that 
		stuff.&nbsp; I don’t have time for all those meetings and marches.&nbsp; I think 
		I’m going to take a pass.&nbsp; I hope it works out, but that’s not something 
		I want to do.”&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I want you to think for a 
		minute about the extraordinary men and women who’ve worn our country’s 
		uniform and have given their last full measure of devotion to keep us 
		safe and free.&nbsp; What if they said -- what if they said, “I really do 
		love this country, but why should I sacrifice so much for people I’ve 
		never even met?”&nbsp; Young men and women in uniform right now making those 
		sacrifices.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So you and I are here today 
		because those people made a different choice.&nbsp; They chose to step up.&nbsp; 
		They chose to serve.&nbsp; And I hope you will follow their example, because 
		there is work to be done, and your country needs you.&nbsp; We’ve got an 
		economy to rebuild.&nbsp; We’ve got children to educate.&nbsp; We’ve got diseases 
		to cure.&nbsp; We’ve got threats to face.&nbsp; We’ve got an oil spill to clean 
		up.&nbsp; We’ve got clean energy to discover.&nbsp; And it is going to be up to 
		you to meet all of those challenges -- to build industries and make 
		discoveries and inspire the next generation.&nbsp; It’s going to be up to you 
		to heal the divide that continues to afflict our world.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, I’m not saying you got 
		to do it here all at once.&nbsp; But as Theodore Roosevelt once put it, I’m 
		asking you to “Do what you can, with what you’ve got, where you are.”&nbsp; 
		And I can guarantee that wherever your journey takes you, there are 
		going to be children who need mentors and senior citizens who need 
		assistance, folks down on their luck who could use a helping hand.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And once you’ve reached out 
		and formed those connections, you’ll find it’s a little harder to numb 
		yourself to other people’s suffering.&nbsp; It’s a little harder to ignore 
		the national debates about the issues that affect their lives and yours.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the end, service binds us 
		to each other -- and to our communities and our country -- in a way that 
		nothing else can.&nbsp; It’s how we become more fully American.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s the reason those 
		donors created the Kalamazoo Promise in the first place -- not for 
		recognition or reward, but because of their connection to this 
		community; because their belief in your potential; because their faith 
		that you would use this gift not just to enrich your own lives, but the 
		lives of others and the life of the nation.</font></p>
