		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you 
		so much. To -- To the great Governor of Iowa and Lieutenant Governor of 
		Iowa; to my dear friend Tom Harkin for the outstanding work that he 
		does; to the congressional delegation of Iowa that is doing outstanding 
		work; and to Nancy Pelosi, Madam Speaker, thank you all for the 
		wonderful welcome and the wonderful hospitality.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I love you back. [to 
		audience]</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A little less than one year 
		from today, you will go into the voting booth and you will select the 
		President of the United States of America. Now, here’s the good news -- 
		the name George W. Bush will not be on the ballot.&nbsp;The name of
		<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21340764/ns/politics/t/lynne-cheney-vp-obama-are-eighth-cousins/">
		<font color="#0000FF">my cousin Dick Cheney</font></a> will not be on 
		the ballot. We’ve been trying to hide that for a long time. Everybody 
		has a black sheep in the family. The era of Scooter Libby justice, and 
		Brownie incompetence, and Karl Rove politics will finally be over.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the question you’re 
		going to have to ask yourself when you caucus in January and you vote in 
		November is, “What’s next for America?” We are in a defining moment in 
		our history.&nbsp;Our nation is at war.&nbsp;The planet is in peril.&nbsp;The dream 
		that so many generations fought for feels as if it’s slowly slipping 
		away.&nbsp;We are working harder for less.&nbsp;We’ve never paid more for health 
		care or for college.&nbsp; It’s harder to save and it’s harder to retire.&nbsp;And 
		most of all we’ve lost faith that our leaders can or will do anything 
		about it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We were promised 
		compassionate conservatism and all we got was
		<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/gwbushhurricanekatrinarelief.htm">
		<font color="#0000FF">Katrina</font></a> and wiretaps. We were promised 
		a uniter, and we got a President who could not even lead the half of the 
		country that voted for him.&nbsp;We were promised a more ethical and more 
		efficient government, and instead we have a town called Washington that 
		is more corrupt and more wasteful than it was before.&nbsp;And the only 
		mission that was ever accomplished is to use fear and falsehood to take 
		this country to a war that should have never been authorized and should 
		have never been waged.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is because of these 
		failures that America is listening, intently, to what we say here today 
		-- not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents who’ve lost 
		trust in their government, but want to believe again. And it is because 
		of these failures that we not only have a moment of great challenge, but 
		also a moment of great opportunity.&nbsp;We have a chance to bring the 
		country together in a new majority -- to finally tackle problems that 
		George Bush made far worse, but that had festered long before George 
		Bush ever took office -- problems that we’ve talked about year after 
		year after year after year.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that is why the same old 
		Washington textbook campaigns just won’t do in this election.&nbsp; That’s 
		why not answering questions ‘cause we are afraid our answers won’t be 
		popular just won’t do. That’s why telling the American people what we 
		think they want to hear instead of telling the American people what they 
		need to hear just won’t do. Triangulating and poll-driven positions 
		because we’re worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us just 
		won’t do.&nbsp;If we are really serious about wining this election Democrats, 
		we can’t live in fear of losing it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This party -- the party of 
		Jefferson and Jackson, of Roosevelt and Kennedy -- has always made the 
		biggest difference in the lives of the American people when we led, not 
		by polls, but by principle; not by calculation, but by conviction; when 
		we summoned the entire nation to a common purpose -- a higher purpose. 
		And I run for the Presidency of the United States of America because 
		that’s the party America needs us to be right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A party that offers not just 
		a difference in policies, but a difference in leadership.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A party that doesn’t just 
		focus on how to win but why we should.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A party that doesn’t just 
		offer change as a slogan, but real, meaningful change -- change that 
		America can believe in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why I’m in this race. 
		That’s why I am running for the Presidency of the United States of 
		America -- to offer change that we can believe in.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am in this race to tell 
		the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in 
		Washington are over.&nbsp;I have done more than any other candidate in this 
		race to take on lobbyists -- and won.&nbsp;They have not funded my campaign, 
		they will not get a job in my White House, and they will not drown out 
		the voices of the American people when I am President.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’m in this race to take 
		those tax breaks away from companies that are moving jobs overseas and 
		put them in the pockets of hard working Americans who deserve it.&nbsp;And I 
		won’t raise the minimum wage every ten years -- I will raise it to keep 
		pace so that workers don’t’ fall behind.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is why I am in it. To 
		protect the American worker. To fight for the American worker.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’m in this race because I 
		want to stop talking about the outrage of 47 million Americans without 
		health care and start actually doing something about it. I expanded 
		health care in Illinois by bringing Democrats and Republicans together.&nbsp; 
		By taking on the insurance industry.&nbsp;And that is how I will make certain 
		that every single American in this country has health care they can 
		count on and I won’t do it twenty years from now, I won’t do it ten 
		years from now, I will do it by the end of my first term as President of 
		the United States of America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I run for president to make 
		sure that every American child has the best education that we have to 
		offer -- from the day they are born to the day they graduate from 
		college.&nbsp;And I won’t just talk about how great teachers are -- as 
		President I will reward them for their greatness -- by raising salaries 
		and giving them more support.&nbsp;That’s why I’m in this race.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am running for President 
		because I am sick and tired of democrats thinking that the only way to 
		look tough on national security is by talking, and acting, and voting 
		like George Bush Republicans.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I am this party’s 
		nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that I voted for the war in 
		Iraq; or that I gave George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; or 
		that I supported Bush-Cheney policies of not talking to leaders that we 
		don’t like.&nbsp;And he will not be able to say that I wavered on something 
		as fundamental as whether or not it is ok for America to torture -- 
		because it is never ok.&nbsp;That’s why I am in it.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As President, I will end the 
		war in Iraq.&nbsp;We will have our troops home in sixteen months.&nbsp;I will 
		close Guantanamo. I will restore habeas corpus.&nbsp;I will finish the fight 
		against Al Qaeda. And I will lead the world to combat the common threats 
		of the 21st century -- nuclear weapons and terrorism; climate change and 
		poverty; genocide and disease.&nbsp;And I will send once more a message to 
		those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, “You matter to 
		us.&nbsp;Your future is our future.&nbsp;And our moment is now.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">America, our moment is now. 
		Our moment is now. I don’t want to spend the next year or the next four 
		years re-fighting the same fights that we had in the 1990s. I don’t want 
		to pit Red America against Blue America, I want to be the President of 
		the United States of America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And if those Republicans 
		come at me with the same fear-mongering and swift-boating that they 
		usually do, then I will take them head on. Because I believe the 
		American people are tired of fear and tired of distractions and tired of 
		diversions. We can make this election not about fear, but about the 
		future.&nbsp;And that won’t just be a Democratic victory; that will be an 
		American victory. And that is a victory America needs right now.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am not in this race to 
		fulfill some long-held ambitions or because I believe it’s somehow owed 
		to me. I never expected to be here, I always knew this journey was 
		improbable. I’ve never been on a journey that wasn’t. I am running in 
		this race because of what Dr. King called “the fierce urgency of now.”&nbsp; 
		Because I believe that there’s such a thing as being too late.&nbsp; And that 
		hour is almost upon us.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t want to wake up four 
		years from now and find out that millions of Americans still lack health 
		care because we couldn’t take on the insurance industry.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t want to see that the 
		oceans have risen a few more inches. The planet has reached a point of 
		no return because we couldn’t find a way to stop buying oil from 
		dictators.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t want to see more 
		American lives put at risk because no one had the judgment or the 
		courage to stand up against a misguided war before we sent our troops 
		into fight.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t want to see homeless 
		veterans on the streets. I don’t want to send another generation of 
		American children to failing schools. I don’t want that future for my 
		daughters.&nbsp;I don’t want that future for your sons.&nbsp;I do not want that 
		future for America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’m in this race for the 
		same reason that I fought for jobs for the jobless and hope for the 
		hopeless on the streets of Chicago; for the same reason I fought for 
		justice and equality as a civil rights lawyer; for the same reason that 
		I fought for Illinois families for over a decade.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because I will never forget 
		that the only reason that I’m standing here today is because somebody, 
		somewhere stood up for me when it was risky.&nbsp;Stood up when it was hard. 
		Stood up when it wasn’t popular.&nbsp;And because that somebody stood up, a 
		few more stood up.&nbsp;And then a few thousand stood up.&nbsp;And then a few 
		million stood up.&nbsp;And standing up, with courage and clear purpose, they 
		somehow managed to change the world.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why I’m running, Iowa 
		-- to give our children and grandchildren the same chances somebody gave 
		me.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why I’m running, 
		Democrats -- to keep the American Dream alive for those who still hunger 
		for opportunity, who still thirst for equality.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s why I’m asking you to 
		stand with me, that’s why I’m asking you to caucus for me, that’s why I 
		am asking you to stop settling for what the cynics say we have to 
		accept.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this election -- in this 
		moment -- let us reach for what we know is possible. A nation healed.&nbsp; A 
		world repaired. An America that believes again.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you very much 
		everybody.</font></p>
