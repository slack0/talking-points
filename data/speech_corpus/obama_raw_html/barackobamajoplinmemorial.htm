		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>President Obama</u></b>: 
		Thank you.&nbsp;Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so much.&nbsp;Please, please be seated.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>Audience Member</u></b>:&nbsp;I 
		love you, Obama!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>President Obama</u></b>: 
		Oh, I love Joplin!&nbsp;I love Joplin.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>President Obama</u></b>:&nbsp;To 
-- </font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>Audience Member</u></b>:&nbsp;We 
		love Joplin!</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><u>President Obama</u></b>:&nbsp;We 
		love Joplin.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you, Governor, for 
		that powerful message, but more importantly, for being here with and for 
		your people every step of the way.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are grateful to you, to 
		Reverend Gariss, Father Monaghan.&nbsp;I’m so glad you got in that tub.&nbsp;To 
		Reverend Brown for that incredibly powerful message.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To Senator Claire 
		McCaskill, who’s been here, and Congressman Billy Long; Mayor Woolston. 
		To Craig Fugate.&nbsp;It doesn’t get a lot of attention, but he heads up 
		FEMA, our emergency response at the federal level.&nbsp;He’s been going from 
		Tuscaloosa to Joplin and everywhere in between tirelessly doing 
		outstanding work.&nbsp;We’re grateful for him. Gail McGovern, the President 
		of the National Red Cross, which has contributed mightily to the 
		rebuilding efforts here.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most of all, to the family 
		and friends of all those who’ve been lost and all those who’ve been 
		affected.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today we gather to 
		celebrate the lives of those we’ve lost to the storms here in Joplin and 
		across the Midwest, to keep in our prayers those still missing, to mourn 
		with their families, to stand together during this time of pain and 
		trial.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And as Reverend Brown 
		alluded to, the question that weighs on us at a time like this 
		is:&nbsp;Why?&nbsp;Why our town?&nbsp;Why our home? Why my son, or husband, or wife, or 
		sister, or friend?&nbsp;Why?</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We do not have the 
		capacity to answer. We can’t know when a terrible storm will strike, or 
		where, or the severity of the devastation that it may cause. We can’t 
		know why we’re tested with the loss of a loved one, or the loss of a 
		home where we’ve lived a lifetime.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These things are beyond 
		our power to control.&nbsp;But that does not mean we are powerless in the 
		face of adversity.&nbsp;How we respond when the storm strikes is up to 
		us.&nbsp;How we live in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache, that’s within 
		our control.&nbsp;And it’s in these moments, through our actions, that we 
		often see the glimpse of what makes life worth living in the first 
		place.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the last week, that’s 
		what Joplin has not just taught Missouri, not just taught America, but 
		has taught the world. I was overseas in the aftermath of the storm, and 
		had world leaders coming up to me saying, let the people of Joplin know 
		we are with them; we’re thinking about them; we love them.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because the world saw how 
		Joplin responded. A university turned itself into a makeshift hospital. 
		Some of you used your pickup trucks as ambulances, carrying the injured 
		-- on doors that served as stretchers. Your restaurants have rushed food 
		to people in need. Businesses have filled trucks with donations. You’ve 
		waited in line for hours to donate blood to people you know, but also to 
		people you’ve never met.&nbsp; And in all this, you have lived the words of 
		Scripture:</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are troubled on 
			every side, yet not distressed;<br>
			we are perplexed, but not in despair;<br>
			Persecuted, but not forsaken;<br>
			cast down, but not destroyed....</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As the governor said, you 
		have shown the world what it means to love thy neighbor.&nbsp;You’ve banded 
		together.&nbsp;You’ve come to each other’s aid.&nbsp;You’ve demonstrated a simple 
		truth:&nbsp;that amid heartbreak and tragedy, no one is a stranger.&nbsp;Everybody 
		is a brother.&nbsp;Everybody is a sister.&nbsp;We can all love one another.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As you move forward in the 
		days ahead, I know that rebuilding what you’ve lost won’t be easy. I 
		just walked through some of the neighborhoods that have been affected, 
		and you look out at the landscape, and there have to be moments where 
		you just say, where to begin? How to start?&nbsp;There are going to be 
		moments where after the shock has worn off, you feel alone.&nbsp;But there’s 
		no doubt in my mind what the people of this community can do. There’s no 
		doubt in my mind that Joplin will rebuild.&nbsp; And as President, I can 
		promise you your country will be there with you every single step of the 
		way.&nbsp;We will be with you every step of the way.&nbsp;We’re not going 
		anywhere.&nbsp;The cameras may leave.&nbsp;The spotlight may shift.&nbsp;But we will be 
		with you every step of the way until Joplin is restored and this 
		community is back on its feet.&nbsp;We’re not going anywhere.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is not just my 
		promise; that’s America’s promise.&nbsp;It’s a promise I make here in Joplin; 
		it’s a promise I made down in Tuscaloosa, or in any of the communities 
		that have been hit by these devastating storms over the last few weeks.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, there have been 
		countless acts of kindness and selflessness in recent days.&nbsp; We’ve 
		already heard the record of some of that.&nbsp;But perhaps none are as 
		inspiring as what took place when the storm was bearing down on Joplin, 
		threatening an entire community with utter destruction.&nbsp;And in the face 
		of winds that showed no mercy, no regard for human life, that did not 
		discriminate by race or faith or background, it was ordinary people, 
		swiftly tested, who said, “I’m willing to die right now so that someone 
		else might live.”</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was the husband who 
		threw himself over his wife as their house came apart around them.&nbsp; It 
		was the mother who shielded her young son.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		It was Dean Wells, a husband and father who loved to sing and whistle in 
		his church choir.&nbsp;Dean was working a shift at the Home Depot, managing 
		the electrical department, when the siren rang out.&nbsp;He sprang into 
		action, moving people to safety.&nbsp;Over and over again, he went back for 
		others, until a wall came down on top of him.&nbsp; In the end, most of the 
		building was destroyed, but not where Dean had directed his coworkers 
		and his customers.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		There was a young man named Christopher Lucas who was 26 years 
		old.&nbsp;Father of two daughters; third daughter on the way.&nbsp;Just like any 
		other night, Christopher was doing his job as manager on duty at Pizza 
		Hut.&nbsp;And then he heard the storm coming.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was then when this 
		former sailor quickly ushered everybody into the walk-in freezer.&nbsp;The 
		only problem was, the freezer door wouldn’t stay closed from the 
		inside.&nbsp;So as the tornado bore down on this small storefront on Range 
		Line Road, Christopher left the freezer to find a rope or a cord or 
		anything to hold the door shut.&nbsp;He made it back just in time, tying a 
		piece of bungee cord to the handle outside, wrapping the other end 
		around his arm, holding the door closed with all his might.&nbsp;<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		And Christopher held it as long as he could, until he was pulled away by 
		the incredible force of the storm.&nbsp;He died saving more than a dozen 
		people in that freezer.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You see, there are heroes 
		all around us, all the time.&nbsp;They walk by us on the sidewalk, and they 
		sit next to us in class.&nbsp;They pass us in the aisle wearing an orange 
		apron.&nbsp;They come to our table at a restaurant and ask us what we’d like 
		to order.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just as we can’t know why 
		tragedy strikes in the first place, we may never fully understand where 
		these men and women find the courage and strength to do what they 
		did.&nbsp;What we do know is that in a split-second moment where there’s 
		little time for internal reflection or debate, the actions of these 
		individuals were driven by love -- love for a family member, love for a 
		friend, or just love for a fellow human being.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s good to know. In a 
		world that can be cruel and selfish, it’s this knowledge -- the 
		knowledge that we are inclined to love one another, that we’re inclined 
		to do good, to be good -- that causes us to take heart.&nbsp;We see with 
		fresh eyes what’s precious and so fragile and so important to us. We put 
		aside our petty grievances and our minor disagreements.&nbsp;We see ourselves 
		in the hopes and hardships of others.&nbsp;And in the stories of people like 
		Dean and people like Christopher, we remember that each us contains 
		reserves of resolve and compassion. There are heroes all around us, all 
		the time.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so, in the wake of 
		this tragedy, let us live up to their example -- to make each day count 
		-- to live with the sense of mutual regard -- to live with that same 
		compassion that they demonstrated in their final hours.&nbsp;We are called by 
		them to do everything we can to be worthy of the chance that we’ve been 
		given to carry on.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I understand that at a 
		memorial yesterday for Dean, his wife decided to play a recording of 
		Dean whistling a song he loved -- <i>Amazing Grace</i>.&nbsp;The lyrics are a 
		fitting tribute to what Joplin has been through.</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Through many 
			dangers, toils and snares<br>
			I have already come;<br>
			'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far<br>
			and Grace will lead me home…</font></i></p>
			<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yea, when this 
			flesh and heart shall fail,<br>
			And mortal life shall cease,<br>
			I shall possess within the veil,<br>
			A life of joy and peace.</font></i></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">May those we’ve lost know 
		peace, and may Grace guide the people of Joplin home.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">God bless you, and God 
		bless the United States of America.</font></p>
		<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you.</font></p>
