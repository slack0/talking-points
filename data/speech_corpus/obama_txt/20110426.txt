I will be a candidate for reelection in 2012. And, I am going to need each 
and every one of you to get involved.

And I know that a lot of you who were involved in the campaign earlier, 
over the last two years you've probably felt some frustration. There have 
been times where you wanted Washington to change a lot more quickly than it 
has, and it keeps on slipping into those same old bad habits.

But I want everybody here to remember everything we've accomplished over 
the last two years, and the record of accomplishment in making a difference 
for ordinary people: making sure that they can get the health care that 
they need, making sure that they are able to find a job, or get trained for 
a job for the future.

All those things are happening because of you.

And so, if you've been feeling impatient -- and I understand that -- if -- 
if you're feeling frustrated sometimes, that shouldn't be a reason to pull 
back. That's a reason for us to get even more involved. Because we know if 
we've done this much over the last two years, imagine what we can do over 
the next six -- as long as we keep our focus on the future, as long as we 
keep working together.

I'm looking forward to reengaging with all of you.

And -- And I hope you are too.
