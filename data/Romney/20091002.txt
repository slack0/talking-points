Another Stimulus is Not the Answer


By Mitt Romney
October 2, 2009

With every month’s release of bad unemployment numbers, Americans must feel 
like Bill Murray’s character in Groundhog Day. The 263,000 lost jobs in 
September and the rise in the unemployment rate to 9.8 percent was far 
worse than forecast. What’s clear is that the stimulus bill as crafted has 
not worked. President Obama sold the stimulus as an immediate boost to the 
economy that would keep unemployment below eight percent. Rather than put 
the economy on sound footing, it has ushered in a new era of big 
government. Now the liberal voices in Congress will grow for yet another 
stimulus bill. That’s the wrong answer. We can’t afford anymore 
back-breaking debt that further hobbles our ability to remain competitivite 
as a nation. The right answer is to fix the stimulus we have — throw out 
the provisions that are not directly tied to job growth and substitute 
incentives that will stimulate the private sector and create jobs.
